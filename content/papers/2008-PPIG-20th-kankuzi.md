title: "An MCL algorithm based technique for comprehending spreadsheets"
authors: [Bennett Kankuzi, Yirsaw Ayalew]
abstract: "Spreadsheets are computer programs. However, as with programs written in traditional
programming languages, it is very difficult to understand a spreadsheet created by others. This is
because spreadsheet users normally view the superficial numerical (value) view of spreadsheets
although computations are specified through “hidden” cell formulas. The cell formulas also define
the data-flow structure of the spreadsheet. In this paper, we present a technique that highlights
logical areas in spreadsheets which may act as a guide in understanding a spreadsheet. Instead of
focussing their attention on the whole spreadsheet, spreadsheet users may narrow their focus to
one logical area at a time. We identify logical areas in spreadsheets by using the MCL (Markov
Clustering) algorithm on the underlying spreadsheet data-flow graph."
