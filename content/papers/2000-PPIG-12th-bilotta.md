title: "Some problems of Programming in Robotics"
authors: [Eleonora Bilotta, Pietro Pantano]
abstract: "Although there is a vast bibliography on robot control, only in recent year a lot of attention is placed on how to teach control to children and the consequent problems related to this programming activity. In fact, many are the design problems in relation with a good programming activity in robotics.
<br>
In this paper, we analyse some of these problems. In particular:
- programming the robot control;
- the organisation of the program in relation to hardware, software, behaviours and performance design in robotics;
- some educational remarks."
