title: "Gesture–Visualise–Simulate: a framework to support the teaching of computational thinking in primary school classrooms"
authors: [Anthony Trory]
abstract: "The Gesture-Visualise-Simulate framework describes an ordered progression over three distinct conceptual representations and methods of interaction. The sequence decreases in perceptual detail as recommended by Bruner’s modes of representation, and is influenced by recent attempts to apply theories of grounded cognition in an educational setting. The framework will be used to guide the development of an interactive learning environment for use within primary school classrooms. In a computational thinking context, the framework may increase the learner’s ability to interpret written code – a crucial component of debugging, refactoring, and extending algorithms – by promoting engagement with perceptual symbols that ground abstract concepts in sensorimotor information."
