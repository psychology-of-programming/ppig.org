title: "The Programming Language as a Musical Instrument"
authors: [Alan Blackwell, Nick Collins]
abstract: "This paper considers how to achieve new creative advances in the design of programming languages. It is based on the analysis of a single application domain, the practice of Live Coding in a new area of musical performance known as “Laptop” music. Analysis of live coding as a context for programming allows us to escape the implicit assumptions of the commercial office environment in which so much end-user programming has been studied. The programming environments of the future, with increasing deployment of ubiquitous computing technologies, will be unlike offices in many ways. We can prepare for this future by studying extreme varieties of programming today. Live coding is thus an ideal research opportunity for psychology of programming."
