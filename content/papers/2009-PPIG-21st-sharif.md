title: "Further Observation of Open Source Programmers’ Information Seeking"
authors: [Khaironi Yatim Sharif, Jim Buckley]
abstract: "Several authors have proposed information seeking as an appropriate perspective for studying
software maintenance and evolution, and have characterized information seeking empirically in
commercial software evolution settings. However, there is little research in the literature describing
the information seeking behaviour of Open Source programmers, even though Open Source contexts
would seem to exacerbate information seeking problems. That is, team members are typically
delocalized from each other and they are often forced into asynchronous communication.
<br>
This work reports on an empirical study that classifies Open-Source programmers’ information needs,
as generated through open-coding of the questions that appear on their developer mailing lists. The
study details the information sought by Open Source programmers on 3 different mailing lists over
several years and characterizes the responses they obtained. In doing so, several interesting
observations are made about the information these programmers seek, the likelihood that they will
receive responses and the number of responses they are likely to get."
