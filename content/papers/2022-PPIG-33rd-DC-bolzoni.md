title: "Sound-based music style modelling, for a free improvisation musical agent"
authors: [Andrea Bolzoni]
abstract: "This paper presents the first stages of development of an improvising musical agent capable of interacting
with a human musician in a free improvised music context. This research aims to explore the
creative potential of a co-creative system that draws upon two approaches of music and sound generation:
the well-established practice of modelling musical styles with Markov-based models and recent
developments in neural-network-based audio synthesis. At this preliminary stage, the focus is on the
definition of style in a sound-based music context, and the outline of a formal evaluation framework for
style imitation systems."
