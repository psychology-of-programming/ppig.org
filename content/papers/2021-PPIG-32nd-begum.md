title: "Cognition and Distributed Cognition in Software Engineering Research [WIP]"
authors: [Marjahan Begum]
abstract: "The purpose of this paper is to conduct an exploratory literature review in the area of cognition and distributed cognition within software engineering (SE) research. Over arching aims of this literature review are to understand the how individual cognition and distributed cognition are discussed in software engineering research. This is to support empirical studies on the role cognition (individual or team) plays during software development process.

The finding suggest that most of the research to date is empirical but there is also some theoretical research. The research focus has been on: program comprehension, design and review, distributed cognition and how tools can reduce cognitive load for programmers. This analysis provides opportunities for further research in terms of cognitive models and methodological insights."
