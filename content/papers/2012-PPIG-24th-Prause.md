title: "A Field Experiment on Gamification of Code Quality in Agile Development"
authors: [Christian R. Prause, Jan Nonnen, Mark Vinkovits]
abstract: "Internal quality of software reduces development costs in the long run but is often
neglected by developers. CollabReview, a web-based reputation system for improving the quality
of collaboratively written source code, was introduced into an agile development team. The goal
was to improve the quality of developed source code as evidenced by the amount of code entities
furnished with Javadoc comments. A money prize as an extrinsic reward and peer-pressure in form
of a published ranking table were tied to reputation scores. We report on the conduction of a field
experiment, our observations and experiences, and relate the results to answers from concluding
interviews. Although the gamification had less effect than we had hoped, our experiment teaches
valuable lessons about social effects and informs the future design of similar systems."
