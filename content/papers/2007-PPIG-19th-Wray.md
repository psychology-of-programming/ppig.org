title: "SQ Minus EQ can Predict Programming Aptitude"
authors: [Stuart Wray]
abstract: "Students from an introductory programming class were given several
tests in an attempt to establish whether any of their test scores correlated well
with their measured programming ability. It was discovered that, when used in
combination, the Autism Research Centre’s SQ [1] and EQ [2] tests showed a
high correlation (r = .67) with a test for programming ability. Individually, SQ
and EQ show moderate correlation (r = .44 and r = -.45 respectively) with this
programming test. In contrast, for this group of students, Dehnadi and Bornat’s
test [3] and a self-rank test could not be used to successfully predict programming
ability."
