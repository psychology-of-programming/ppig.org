authors: [Josephine Rey, Alan Blackwell, Xinyue Li, Gemma Penson, Hong Ge, Helen Arnold]
abstract: "As Bayesian approaches to probability and statistics become more widespread foundations of machine learning, there is interest in introducing basic principles of probabilistic modelling at secondary school level. This paper presents a series of educational experiments with simple probabilistic modelling tools based on probabilistic programming languages."
