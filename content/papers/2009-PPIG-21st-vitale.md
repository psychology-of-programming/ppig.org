title: "Using computerized procedures for testing and training abstract comparative relations"
authors: [Agata Vitale, Veronica Cullinan]
abstract: "Abstract comparative reasoning is involved whenever one arbitrary stimulus (i.e. not defined by its
physical properties) is related to another in terms of qualitative or quantitative relations. This kind of
reasoning is part of our everyday life, and it is the substratum for other kinds of more complex related
reasoning skills, such as hierarchical relations. Previous studies indicated that normally developed
adults find difficult to solve some comparative relations, even when these simply involve three
elements (e.g. X> U; U<B). The current paper describes the development of automated training
procedures for testing and training abstract comparative reasoning. The use of automated procedures
was essential to the empirical work reported in this paper. It addressed problems of validity such as
the risk that individuals’ performances might be affected by the presence of the experimenter. It also
improved accuracy in recording individuals’ pattern of responses. Furthermore it facilitated the
development of more effective training techniques to improve this kind of reasoning. In Experiment 1
participants were exposed to the same comparative relations among three stimuli (e.g. A, B & C) in
three subsequent identical phases (Phases1, 2 &3). This was done to verify if they could improve
their performance simply by repeated exposures to the same comparative relations. Experiment 2 was
identical to Experiment 1, except that in phase 2 individuals were exposed to training (this involved a
combination of non arbitrary trials and written feedback). The results indicated that the training was
effective, and that individuals in Phase 3 of Experiment 2 performed better than those in Phase 3 of
Experiment 1.

Computer programming, more than other fields, requires flexibility of thinking in abstract terms
(including abstract comparative reasoning). It is therefore hoped that the automated procedures
developed in Experiments 1&2 may provide the basis for similar techniques to test and train
comparative relations in individuals who approach this field for the first time (e.g. students)."
