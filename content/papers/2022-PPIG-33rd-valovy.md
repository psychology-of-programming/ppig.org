title: "Experimental Pair Programming: A Study Design And Preliminary Results"
authors: [Marcel ValovyÃÅ]
abstract: "In the context of facing a period in time where traditional work settings have been challenged,
we require exploring new ways of increasing motivation in software teams. Pair programming is one of
the agile techniques that might increase the motivation of software professionals and, as a result, also
their productivity and creativity. This paper presents a work-in-progress design for conducting mixedmethods
controlled experimental research on assessing, evaluating, and exploring the meaning behind
the relations between personality, motivation, and programming roles."
