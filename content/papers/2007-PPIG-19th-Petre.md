title: "Expert Strategies for Dealing with Complex and Intractable Problems"
authors: [Marian Petre]
abstract: "Software design is a realm of messy problems that are often too big, too ill-defined, too
complex for easy comprehension and solution. Such problems are rarely amenable to solution by
‘brute force’ methods – even at the coding level such problems entail a significant cognitive load.
This talk reports on strategies observed in expert behaviour in dealing with complex and intractable
problems. The strategies arise from a series of in situ observations and interviews with 10 expert
software engineers in the US and UK over 2 years. It appears that experts manage intractable
problems by transforming them: abstracting, simplifying, deferring parts of the problem, translating
them into a different representation, and so on. A range of such strategies is identified and
described, and implications of expert reasoning about intractable problems are discussed."
