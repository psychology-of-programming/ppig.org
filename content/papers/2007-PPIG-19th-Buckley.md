title: "ESCAPE Meta Modeling in Software Engineering: When Premature Commitment is Useful in Representations"
authors: [Jim Buckley, Chris Exton, Aaron Quigley, Andrew LeGear]
abstract: "This paper introduces, and provides a cognitive basis for, a prototype
meta-modeling process called ESCAPE. This process involves users Explicitly
Stating their own model of an entity of interest, CAPturing an alternative or
correct model of that entity and consequently re-Evaluating their own model.
The paper shows the modelâ€™s implicit, but already well established, use in the
software engineering domain. In particular, it focuses on empirical work carried
out in Software Understanding and Architectural Recovery of large commercial
software systems using the Reflexion modeling process, which embodies
ESCAPE meta-modeling principles. Finally, it suggests several areas where
ESCAPE meta-modeling could be beneficially applied in software engineering."
