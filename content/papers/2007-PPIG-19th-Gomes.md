title: "Problem solving in progr"
authors: [Anabela Gomes, António José Mendes]
abstract: "We think that the major cause of the students’ failure in introductory
programming course is the lack of a basic skill, the problem solving ability.
Several authors frequently regarded this skill as the most important cognitive
activity in everyday, professional and educational contexts. In traditional
programming teaching, generic problem solving is not emphasized. In this
paper we discuss the concepts and stages of problem solving, considering also
how experts and novices solve problems. The idea is that this analysis leads to a
number of important principles for teach and learn problem solving strategies.
The main purpose of this paper is to present the features of a system currently
under development to support programming learning, focusing in problem
solving activities."
