title: "Directions in Computational Music"
authors: [Ian Clester]
abstract: "This doctoral consortium submission describes my work on computational music, which has primarily
focused on three problems: representation, distribution, and environment. Among other topics, this
work relates to programming language design, interactive development, live coding, and programming
interfaces. I welcome feedback from the PPIG community, especially regarding methodology and future
directions, which I anticipate will prove helpful at this juncture midway through my doctoral program."
