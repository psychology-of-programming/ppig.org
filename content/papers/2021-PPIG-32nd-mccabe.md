title: "Progger: Programming by Errors (Work In Progress)"
authors: [Alan T. McCabe, Emma Söderberg, Luke Church]
abstract: "This paper describes a work in progress implementation of a programming tool that puts errors and their provenance at the forefront of the interaction between a developer and a compiler. We discuss the motivation for such a tool, it’s design and implementation, and reflect upon avenues for further research which it can facilitate."
