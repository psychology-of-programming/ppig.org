title: "The Programming Walkthrough: A Structured Method for Assessing the Writability of Programming Languages"
authors: [Brigham Bell, Wayne Citrin, Clayton Lewis, John Rieman, Robert Weaver, Nick Wilde, Benjamin Zorn]
abstract: "We describe a method for assessing the writability of a programming language by examining the steps required in creating sample programs and weighing the knowledge required to choose among alternative steps. We present experience in applying the method in four language design projects, and argue that the method is a useful supplement to existing approaches."
