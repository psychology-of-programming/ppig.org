title: "Assisting Concept Location in Software Comprehension"
authors: [Brendan Cleary, Chris Exton]
abstract: "Concept location, the problem of associating human oriented concepts
with their counterpart solution domain concepts, is a fundamental problem that
lies at the heart of software comprehension. Recent research has attempted to
alleviate the impact of the concept location problem through the application of
methods drawn from the Information Retrieval (IR) community. Here we present
a new approach based on a complimentary IR method which also has a sound
basis in cognitive theory. We compare our approach to related work through an
experiment and present our conclusions."
