title: "Little Languages for Little Robots"
authors: [Matthew C. Jadud, Brooke N. Chenoweth, Jacob Schleter]
abstract: "With serendipity as our muse, we have created tools that allow students to author languages of their own design for robots of their own construction. In developing a Scheme compiler for the LEGO Mindstorm we realized that there is great educational potential in the design and creation of new languages for small robotics kits. As a side effect of bringing Scheme and the Mindstorm together in a creative context, we have begun an exploration of teaching language design that is fundamentally different from the treatment of the subject in traditional literature."
