title: "Towards understanding Source and Configuration Management tools as a method of introducing learners to the culture of software development"
authors: [Aidan Delaney]
abstract: "Despite the lingering stereotype, computer science and programming
has long abandoned the development model consisting of a
lone programmer writing code into the early hours of the morning. There
may be aspects of this heroism in a product development cycle, particularly
when close to a release date, however to bring a software product
to market requires collaboration within a team of programmers. Developing
software products, as opposed to simply programming, is a social
process. We believe that learners gain a greater understanding of the
software development process through social interaction with other developers.
Such beliefs are consistent with the General Genetic Law of
Cultural Development proposed by Lev S. Vygotsky. We consider Free
and Open Source software development to be a readily available repository
of differing development processes to use in introducing learners to
the social side of software development. The contribution of this paper
is to introduce and expand upon a vocabulary for discussing Source and
Configuration Management tools in a Vygotskyian context."
