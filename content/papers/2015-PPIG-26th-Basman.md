title: "Harmonious Authorship from Different Representations (Work in Progress)"
authors: [Antranig Basman, Colin Clark, Clayton Lewis]
abstract: "We describe the Infusion system, which is a library, language system or integration
domain implemented in JavaScript, as well as a mentality and model for thinking about the expression of end-user applications. We promise that this system will bring together the worlds of
different kinds of users engaged in different tasks at different times, and allow them shared authorial
access to the same artefacts which are presented to each in a notation appropriate for them."
