title: "The impact of POGIL-like learning on student understanding of software testing and DevOps: A qualitative study"
authors: [Bhuvana Gopal, Ryan Bockmon, Stephen Cooper]
abstract: "In this study, we analyze students’ understanding of unit testing, integration testing and continuous integration
in a semester long undergraduate software engineering course, after they underwent instruction
using POGIL-like, a guided inquiry based pedagogy. At the end of the course, we collected student
responses to open ended questions regarding their understanding of these topics, combining them with
researcher memos as well as reflective researcher journals. We analyzed these written responses and
identified the themes that we came up with regarding how students learned and potentially overcame
difficulties with software testing and DevOps. Some of those themes that emerged from our qualitative
analysis were: What makes writing and maintaining tests difficult? Where do you start unit testing a
method? How do you know if you have written enough tests for the System Under Test (SUT)? How
do you identify the most important functionality to test, in a SUT? Does your testing accomplish all
functionality goals?
<br>
We investigate and discuss students’ answers to these questions in detail. We attempt to understand if
the POGIL-like approach helped students overcome some of the difficulties students expressed in our
earlier work on the same topic in a previously published study."
