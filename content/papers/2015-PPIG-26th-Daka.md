title: "Improving Readability of Automatically Generated Unit Tests"
authors: [Ermira Daka]
abstract: "Unit testing is a commonly applied technique in object-oriented programming, where
classes are tested using small, executable tests written as code. It is a laborious, time-consuming,
and error prone job, and even after tests are written, it requires developer to maintain them, and
to understand code written by other developers. To support developers, unit test can be generated
automatically using different testing techniques. However, since algorithms used for test generation
are typically guided by structural criteria, generated unit tests are often long and confusing, and
with possible negative effect in the test oracle problem and test maintenance. To overcome this
problem we investigate the readability of unit test cases. We propose a domain-specific model of
unit test readability based on human judgments, and use this model to guide automated unit test
generation. The resulting approach can automatically generate test cases with improved readability
with the overall objective of reducing the effort for developers to understand these test cases."
