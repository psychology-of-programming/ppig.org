title: "Problem-Solving Applications in Developer Environments"
authors: [Nicholas Nelson]
abstract: "Programming is inherently a problem solving exercise: A programmer has to create an understanding
of the situation, externalize and contextualize thoughts and ideas, develop strategies on how to proceed
with the task, enact changes according to the most appropriate strategy, and reflect to learn from
each problem. Therefore, programming is clearly more than just code input, testing, and maintenance.
However, modern development environments largely focus on the “writing code” parts of programming.
To support all aspects of problem solving in programming, we propose a new Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) which uses a dynamic, expressive, and human-centric cards and canvas paradigm."
