abstract: "Paper prototyping is an effective strategy for digital game designers to explore a design space. However, a large area of the design space is out of reach for paper: prototypes that need to react to player reflexes are challenging to realize. Many game genres use player reflexes as an integral part of their concept.
Through a set of examples, we analyze factors that contribute to the effectiveness and spontaneous spirit of paper prototyping. We then propose digital tool support designed to broaden the scope of paper prototyping, by introducing computation to paper arrangement, while maintaining its effectiveness and spontaneous spirit. We present and discuss the design of an explorative study to evaluate the concept."
