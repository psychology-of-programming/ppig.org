title: "Useful but tedious: An evaluation of mobile spreadsheets"
authors: [Derek Flood, Rachel Harrison, Ann Nosseir]
abstract: "The processing power of mobile devices has greatly increased in recent years. This increased power
has allowed for a greater range of applications to be deployed on this platform, providing constant
access to information for end users. The limited size of these devices however, causes a number of
usability issues which make these applications error prone and difficult to use. This paper presents
current research being undertaken into the use of spreadsheets, an important end-user development
environment, on a mobile device. The key errors observed during this work are presented here to
highlight some of the problems with using spreadsheets in this way. We believe these problems may
be due to the increased cognitive load placed on users who try to use spreadsheets in a mobile context."
