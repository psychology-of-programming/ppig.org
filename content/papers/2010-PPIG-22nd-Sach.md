title: "The use of MBTI in Software Engineering"
authors: [Rien Sach, Marian Petre, Helen Sharp]
abstract: "In this paper we evaluate the use of Carl Jungâ€™s theories of Psychological Type assessed using the
Myer-Briggs Type Indicator in the Software Engineering field. The current level of implementation
and its quality is established and the results discussed to provide insight into what we currently know,
and suggestions on what could be important to investigate for the future.
<br>
Upon gathering MBTI data from a range of sources it is apparent that there is agreement on the types
of personalities often discovered inside software engineering. Thinking and judging personality
preferences are commonly found, while feeling and perceiving is far less common. This differs
substantially from results representative of the American population, and supports the belief that
software engineers are more commonly represented by specific types of people.
<br>
However, there is discrepancy between four of the 16 types identified in the MBTI, suggesting that
there is still some understanding to be gained about personality in software engineering, and we do
not by any means know the exact breakdown of types present within the industry."
