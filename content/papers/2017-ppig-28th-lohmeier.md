title: "Towards Webcam-based Eye Tracking in the Eclipse IDE"
authors: [Sebastian Lohmeier]
abstract: "Eye tracking is used in program comprehension research and is potentially useful for enhancing integrated development environments (IDEs). While eye tracking plug-ins exist for the Eclipse IDE, eye trackers do not typically work on operating systems other than Windows. To make empirical studies accessible to programmers working on Linux or MacOS, a recently presented webcam-based eye tracker is being adapted to the Java platform and provided as a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE. The eye tracker shall demonstrate eye tracking in the IDE without external devices to stimulate ideas of how to improve webcam-based eye tracking and how eye tracking could be used to improve program comprehension research and IDEs."
