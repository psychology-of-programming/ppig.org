title: "Cognitive Perspectives on the Role of Naming in Computer Programs"
authors: [Ben Liblit, Andrew Begel, Eve Sweetser]
abstract: "Programming a computer is a complex, cognitively rich process. This
paper examines ways in which human cognition is reflected in the text of computer
programs. We concentrate on naming: the assignment of identifying labels
to programmatic constructs. Naming is arbitrary, yet programmers do not select
names arbitrarily. Rather, programmers choose and use names in regular, systematic
ways that reflect deep cognitive and linguistic influences. This, in turn, allows
names to carry semantic cues that aid in program understanding and support the
larger software development process."
