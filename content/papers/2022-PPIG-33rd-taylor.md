title: "A Tour Through Code: Helping Developers Become Familiar with Unfamiliar Code"
authors: [Grace Taylor, Steven Clarke]
abstract: "Becoming familiar with an existing code base can be a challenging and time-consuming process. A
developer who is new to a code base and needs to implement a new feature or fix a bug might browse
and search the code base for locations providing good starting points for their task. From these starting
points they may then navigate to other locations in the code base by traversing semantic and other
relationships in the source code that may be relevant to their task. Although most developer tools
provide ways to discover some of these different relationships, the relevance of specific relationships
can often only be determined after traversing the relationship. This often necessitates some amount of
backtracking as a developer navigates one relationship to a new destination in the source code, only to
find that the destination is not relevant to their task. Furthermore, many such relationships between
different locations in source code cannot easily be determined by developer tools alone. This paper
presents the results of a study that investigated the use of CodeTour, a tool that enables the creation and
presentation of annotated code tours through a code base. Such tours can indicate relationships between
locations in a code base that are relevant to a task, but which could be difficult to identify using regular
features found in developer tools. The paper describes the extent to which these code tours helped
developers find the source of bugs and compares the experience with those who attempted the same
task without the tool."
