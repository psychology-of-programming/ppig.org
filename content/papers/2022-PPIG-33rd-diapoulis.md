title: "Livecode me: Live coding practice and multimodal experience"
authors: [Georgios Diapoulis]
abstract: "I present a practice-led research design to explore relations between listening and non-listening conditions
during a month-long live coding practice. A documentation of the live coding sessions and textual
data from my daily diaries are presented in a git repository. The study offers a set of observations related
to musical and programming practices, an ongoing work on a visual helper and outlines issues related to
solo live coding practice."
