title: "Mental Models of Recursion: A Secondary Analysis of Novice Learners’ Steps and Errors in Java Exercises"
authors: [Natalie Kiesler]
abstract: "Teaching and learning recursive programming has been the subject of numerous research projects and
studies. However, few research publications focus on learners’ steps while solving recursive tasks and
the corresponding identification of mental models. It is the goal of this secondary analysis to identify
the challenges novice learners of Java encounter in recursive problem solving and to map them to the
mental models and conceptions from the literature. The investigated dataset was collected via thinking
aloud experiments with eleven first-year-students of computer science in a professional usability laboratory.
Students had to recursively compute the factorial of n and the Fibonacci sequence in a learning
environment. By using deductive categories from the literature, the students’ performance was evaluated
in terms of their programming steps, their challenges/errors, and thus their ability to generate a
recursive function. The results show that mental models can partially be identified via the analysis of
students’ problem solving steps and errors. Moreover, recursive tasks with more than one recursive call
are more challenging for novice learners. The passive flow of control along with the end of the recursion
chain also seem to be counterintuitive for learners. The lack of viable, complete mental models
implies the need for further educational research on instructional methods addressing these challenges
of first-year students. Learning to program may be easy, but novices require fine-grained, step-by-step
scaffolding and instruction, as well as time to understand and apply the more abstract concepts, which
include recursion."
