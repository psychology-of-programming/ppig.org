title: "Thrashing, Tolerating and Compromising in Software Development"
authors: [Tamara Lopez, Marian Petre, Bashar Nuseibeh]
abstract: "Software engineering research into error commonly examines how developers pass
judgement: to isolate faults, establish their causes and remove them. By contrast this research
examines how developers experience and learn from things that go wrong. This paper presents an
analysis of retrospective accounts of software development gathered from a single organisation. The
report includes findings of how work is conducted in this organisation, and three themes that have
emerged in analysis are discussed: thrashing, tolerating and compromising. Finally, limitations and
implications for future research are given."
