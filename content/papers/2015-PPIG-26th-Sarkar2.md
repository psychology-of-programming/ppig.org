title: "Confidence, command, complexity: metamodels for structured interaction with machine intelligence"
authors: [Advait Sarkar]
abstract: "Programming is a form of dialogue with machines. In recent years, we have become
increasingly involved in a dialogue that shapes our surroundings, as we come to inhabit a newly
inferred world. It is unclear how this dialogue should be structured, especially as the notion of \"correctness\" for these programs is now unknown or ill-defined. I present a speculative discussion
of a potential solution: metamodels of machine cognition."
