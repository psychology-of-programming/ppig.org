title: "Winter is Coding: On Programming & The Freeze Response"
authors: [Michael Nagle]
abstract: "Much of the pioneering work in the first UI designs for a programmable computer were grounded in cognitive science. This paper takes the jumping off point that nervous system science can offer new insights into programmable UI design now in the way that cognitive science did 40 years ago. Specifically, we can look at "mathphobia" as a conditioned freeze response to symbolic reasoning. Polyvagal theory suggests orientation to the environment and social connection as two ways to help "thaw" the freeze response. We explore two examples of what that would mean from a UI and UX perspective here."
