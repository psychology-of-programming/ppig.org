title: "Breaking down and making up - a lens for conversing with compilers"
authors: [Luke Church, Emma Söderberg, Alan T. McCabe]
abstract: "This paper proposes a ‘tool for thinking with’: that we can describe the interaction between people
and computers, and especially people and developer tools, as a form of conversation. We outline this
perspective, construct a work in progress analytical frame, and use it to talk about a couple of different
examples and draw implications for future work."
