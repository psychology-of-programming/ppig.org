title: "A Grounded Theory of Cognitive Load Drivers in Novice Agile Software Development Teams"
authors: [Daniel Helgesson, Daniel Appelquist, Per Runeson]
abstract: "Objective: The purpose of this paper is to identify the largest cognitive challenges faced by novices,
developing software in teams, using distributed cognition as an observational filter.
<br>
Paradigm: Design science
<br>
Epistemology: Pragmatist
<br>
Methodology: Case study
<br>
Method: Using grounded theory, ethnography and multi method data collection, we conducted an
observational study for two months following four 10-person novice agile teams, consisting of computer
science students, tasked with developing software systems.
<br>
Result: This paper identifies version control and merge operations as the largest challenge faced by the
novices, and provides a substantive theory generated from our empirical data explaining the observed
phenomena. The literature studies reveal that little research appears to have been carried out in the area
of version control from a user perspective.
<br>
Limitations: A qualitative study on students is not applicable in all contexts, but the result is credible
and grounded in data and substantiated by extant literature.
<br>
Conclusion: We conclude that our findings motivate further research on cognitive perspectives to guide
improvement of software engineering and its tools."
