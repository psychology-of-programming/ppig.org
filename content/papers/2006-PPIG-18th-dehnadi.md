title: "Testing Programming Aptitude"
authors: [Saeed Dehnadi]
abstract: "An initial cognitive study of early learning of programming aimed to extract experimental
test data to establish novicesâ€™ understanding process has been carried out
by us [1]. This empirical study was inspired by the notion that different people bring
different patterns of knowledge in any new learning process, and demonstrated that
how each student tackles the problem in a different way based on their mental model.
The initial study suggests that success in the first stage of an introductory programming
course is predictable, by noting consistency in use of the mental models which
students apply to a basic programming problem even before they have had any contact
with programming notation, but the consistency/inconsistency measurement was
somewhat subjective. In this paper I present an objective marking method which hope
will lead us to more precise and more finely-graduated predictions. This method is being
trialed in at least one experiment, and we hope that by the time of the conference I
will be able to describe the results."
