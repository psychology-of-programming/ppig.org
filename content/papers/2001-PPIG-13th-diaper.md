title: "The Model Matters: Constructing and Reasoning with Heterarchical Structural Models"
authors: [Dan Diaper]
abstract: "An office pool scenario is used to evaluate construction and reasoning with two types of tree diagram, a table and Simplified Set Theory for System Modelling (SST4SM). SST4SM is a formal method that has been designed for non-mathematicians. The scenario requires a non-hierarchical, i.e. heterarchical, structural model. The four approaches are ranked on various construction and reasoning tasks and the rankingsâ€™ rationale is described. Overall, the tree diagrams, for all their ubiquity, are shown to be harder to construct and reason with than either the table or SST4SM."
