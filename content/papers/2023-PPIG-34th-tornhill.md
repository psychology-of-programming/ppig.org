title: "Socio-Technical Smells: How Technical Problems Cause Organizational Friction"
authors: [Adam Tornhill]
abstract: "Successful software development requires that you keep code and people in balance so that one
supports the other. It's a hard challenge since a piece of code doesn't reveal anything about its
socio-technical context. Enter behavioral code analysis, an approach which combines code level
metrics with data on how teams interact within the code. Armed with these techniques, we look to
reduce organizational friction by focusing on a set of common challenges:
<br>
* Identify architectural coordination bottlenecks and understand the technical root causes.
<br>
* Visualize implicit dependencies between teams, act to decouple teams.
<br>
* Discover knowledge risks by measuring the Truck Factor. Learn how to mitigate it.
<br>
* Communicate the scaling risks inherent in Brooks's Law by showing data on how it impacts
your delivery.
<br>
* Go beyond technical impact by knowing how bad code causes unhappiness, low morale, and
increased attrition."
