title: "Vernacular Languages for Mechatronic Making"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "This paper proposes a way of thinking about physical making, from the perspective of end-user
programming. It addresses current interest arising from the Maker/Hackerspace movement, which
aims to democratise the means of creating new mechanical and electronic (mechatronic) devices. By
applying insights from the domain of end-user programming, it proposes ways that mechatronic
making can be made more accessible to a wider audience, just as programming has been made more
accessible to a wider audience through end-user programming."
