title: "PUX Explorer: An Interactive Critique and Ideation Tool for Notation Designers"
authors: [Justas Brazauskas, Alan Blackwell]
abstract: "PUX Explorer is a meta-design tool for use by designers of programming languages and other nota- tional systems, in the tradition of Greenâ€™s Cognitive Dimensions. Together with PUX Matrix and PUX Personas, these tools build on critical frameworks for notation design, informed by a general theory of design ideation. We evaluated PUX Explorer in a controlled study of meta-design, with specialist designers of new music notations. We find that these tools are effective and accessible design aids for meta-designers, not requiring specialist technical expertise."
