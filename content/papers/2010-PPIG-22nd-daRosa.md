title: "The Construction of the Concept of Binary Search Algorithm"
authors: [Sylvia da Rosa]
abstract: "The general goal of this paper is to describe how Piaget’s theory-Genetic Epistemologycan
contribute to computer science education research. Using, as an example, students’ understanding
of the binary search algorithm, this paper illustrates how theoretical principles are applied to
identify some obstacles that students face while solving an instance of that algorithm and to help
students to surmount these obstacles. The methodology of research consists in conducting students
interviews in which they are encouraged to express their solutions in natural language. The specific
goal of the paper is to show how Piaget’s ideas are used as guidelines in the design of the interviews
and in the analysis of the gathered information. Selected excerpts from students’ interviews are
included."
