title: "Why Don’t They Do What We Want Them to Do?"
authors: [Shmuel Schwarz, Mordechai Ben-Ari]
abstract: "This paper describes an investigation into the factors affecting a
student’s decision whether to construct a state transition diagram in order to
verify the correctness of a concurrent program, or whether to verbally verify
the program. We conjectured that the advantages of the visual formal tool
would cause it to be adopted as a routine part of the students’ practice, but in
fact the verbal description was the dominant method of their practice. This
paper describes the reasoning that the students used in choosing a proof
method. Psychological factors such as personal commitment and evaluation of
effort turned out to be more important than the appropriateness of the tool for
achieving the goal."
