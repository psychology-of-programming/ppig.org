title: "Communication in Testing: Improvements for Testing Management"
authors: [Tuula Pääkkönen, Jorma Sajaniemi]
abstract: "Testing in companies with highly competitive environments has many opportunities
and challenges. Testing is diversified, both contextually and geographically: there are many testing
goals, many ongoing parallel projects, many testing phases and all this needs to be managed so
that the full view of testing is visible for management and reporting. Testing is also linked to
project communication and psychology: communication needs to be constructive, and testers and
test leaders should have good interpersonal skills. It really does matter how a failure or test report
is formulated.
<br>
In order to localize testing problems in a large software-intensive company, we conducted a current
state analysis via web-based questionnaire among experienced testing practitioners, most having
at least 5 years experience in these tasks. The scope of the survey was decided to keep broad with
the goal of finding future improvements within tool, process and method development.
In this paper, we will concentrate on those survey results that have psychological underlying.
Based on the results, we suggest a set of improvements for testing and, especially, test reporting.
Implementation of these improvements is still underway, but the findings and suggestions provide
insight into psychology of testing."
