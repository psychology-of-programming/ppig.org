title: "Evaluation of a Live Visual Constraint Language with Professional Artists"
authors: [Meredydd Williams]
abstract: "A qualitative study of the Palimpsest visual language was undertaken to understand how it would be best used by professional visual artists. Previous work found that individuals with high levels of self-efficacy in both the visual arts and computer use are able to use Palimpsest most effectively. An extension to champagne prototyping was used to study whether visual artists find the language more engaging when their own artworks are being used, and when within their own professional environment. It was found that individuals indeed find most utility in the system when manipulating works similar to their artistic style, and approach tasks differently within their own studios. This offers future opportunities for undertaking studies of professional environments."
