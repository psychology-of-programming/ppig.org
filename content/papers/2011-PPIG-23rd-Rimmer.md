title: "Class participation and shyness: affect and learning to program"
authors: [Jon Rimmer, Judith Good, Eric Harris, Madeline Balaam]
abstract: "This paper reports tentative results from a recent case study conducted with novice undergraduate
computer programmers. These new computer science students completed a shyness scale
questionnaire and were then observed using two kinds of technology that logged their self-rated
emotions during their lab-based exercise classes whilst they learned to program using Java.
Participants were then interviewed about their use of the technology, their experiences of learning to
program and of asking questions within teaching and learning environments. The results here focus on
the emerging themes concerning shyness and inhibitions that surround asking and answering
questions. It highlights shyness as being a general part of the experience of a computer science
undergraduate student, the importance of providing a suitable environment conducive to facilitating
questions and answers, and considers how technology might be developed in the future to better
support the needs of these students."
