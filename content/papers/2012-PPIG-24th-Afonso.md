title: "Evaluating application programming interfaces as communication artefacts"
authors: [Luiz Marques Afonso, Renato F. de G. Cerqueira, Clarisse Sieckenius de Souza]
abstract: "Application programming interfaces (APIs) allow the reuse of software artefacts by
providing abstractions to other software layers, and their design is critical to enable the effective
use of the underlying software and avoid programming errors. As such, the role of an API designer
should be strengthened in any software project that has reuse among its goals. Also, we should
be able to evaluate the effectiveness of an API in communicating its design to programmers and
identify the tools and techniques that help the designers to accomplish this task, so that APIs
may be easier to understand and use. This paper describes a work in progress that proposes the
use of a combined semiotic and cognitive method to evaluate APIs as an artefact mediating the
communication process between designers and programmers, and also aims to investigate some
possibilities of enhancing this communication."
