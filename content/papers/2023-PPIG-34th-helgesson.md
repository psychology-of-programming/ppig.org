title: "Exploring cognitive waste and cognitive load in software development - a grounded theory"
authors: [Daniel Helgesson]
abstract: "This paper provides theoretical account of a critical/grounded theory study in industrial software engineering/
development settings. We extend our research into the ’critical ethnography’ domain, drawing
on Rosen, by revisiting previously collected data using social theory as a theoretical filter. We explore
the relations and underlying tensions between alienation and absence of user centered design in regards
to software development tools design using a critical lens. We further experiment with representation
of qualitative data and analysis using commentary excerpt units. We present a grounded theory account
of the consequences of absent user centred design activities in regards to digital tools in industrial
software engineering. We conclude that not deploying user centered design when developing software
development tools is really (stressing really) bad waste management policy for a multitude of reasons."
