title: "Metaphors we program by"
authors: [Christopher Douce]
abstract: "Due to the inherent abstract nature of certain types of software development, programmers and software engineers use metaphoric language throughout many areas of their work. This paper examines some of the many metaphors found within software development and engineering. A simplistic taxonomy is used to present the metaphors that have been found. The use and importance of metaphor and programming are discussed and some consideration is given towards the origins of metaphor. Intersections with other disciplines interested in this topic are also presented. It is concluded that software developers should ideally possess the ability to both understand and to generate new metaphors to successfully develop usable and successful software."
