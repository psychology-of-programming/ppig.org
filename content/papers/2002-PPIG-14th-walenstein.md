title: "HASTI: A Lightweight Framework for Cognitive Reengineering Analysis"
authors: [Andrew Walenstein]
abstract: "Many software development tools and environments are considered useful because they beneficially reengineer developer cognition. Consequently, to design useful computer tools in cognitive work domains such as software development, one needs to be able to appreciate the possibilities for improving cognition. We argue that to do this, designers need more appropriate cognitive theories and models. In particular, they need models designed to highlight cognitive reengineering possibilities and issues. To address this need, we propose a lightweight modeling framework called HASTI. The intent of HASTI is to support “quick and dirty” cognitive reengineering analysis during the early stages of design. We illustrate HASTI’s applicability in analyzing cognitive support in software development tools."
