title: "Software Design using G.O.O.S.E."
authors: [David Budgen, Mitch Thomson]
abstract: "This paper reports early findings from a series of on-going longitudinal studies of the cognitive and organisational factors involved in building large scale software programs. In particular we focus upon one software project within a large UK bank. Our approach has been to concentrate upon the distribution of expertise and knowledge on the project; the organisation of project work; the use of CASE tools; and the problems faced by project members and mechanisms for dealing with these. As a means of partially integrating organisational and cognitive approaches to this area, as well as providing a framework for our research, we introduce a model of what we term the \"division of cognitive labour\"."
