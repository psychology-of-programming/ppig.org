title: "Spatial Ability and Learning to Program"
authors: [Sue Jones, Gary Burnett]
abstract: "Results in introductory programming modules are often
disappointing, and various individual differences have been found to be of
relevance. This paper reviews work in this area, with particular reference to the
effect of a studentâ€™s spatial ability. Data is presented on a cohort of 49 students
enrolled on a Masters in IT course at a university in the UK. A measure was
taken of their mental rotation ability, and a questionnaire administered that
focused on their previous academic experience, and expectations relating to the
introductory programming module they were studying. The results showed a
positive correlation between mental rotation ability and success in the module
(r=0.48). Other factors such as confidence level, expected success and
programming experience were also found to be important. Data from a
subgroup of students who had chosen to continue with programming showed a
stronger correlation between spatial skills and programming success (r=0.57).
These results are discussed in relation to the accessibility of programming to
learners with low spatial ability."
