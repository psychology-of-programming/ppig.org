title: "Story-thinking, computational-thinking, programming and software engineering"
authors: [Austen Rainer, Catherine Menon]
abstract: "Working with stories and working with computations require different modes of thought. We call the
first mode “story-thinking” and the second ”computational-thinking”. The aim of this paper is to explore
the nature of these two modes of thinking, and to do so in relation to programming, including software
engineering as programming-in-the-large. We use two stories as illustrative examples: a famous six word
story and the Byzantine Generals Problem. With these two stories, we explore one fundamental problem,
i.e., the problem of “neglectful representations”. We briefly suggest ways in which this problem might
be tackled, and briefly summarise our ongoing investigations."
