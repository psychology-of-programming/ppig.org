authors: [Charles Boisvert, Chris Roast, Elizabeth Uruchurtu]
abstract: "This paper presents open piping, a box-and-wire programming environment, then uses Cognitive Dimensions of Notations to analyse its interaction design and identify its weaknesses. Physics of Notations gives a complementary perspective to propose solutions which we present by example. We also discuss the respective uses and benefits of Cognitive Dimensions and Physics of Notations in this work."
