title: "An ethnography of XP practice"
authors: [Helen Sharp, Hugh Robinson]
abstract: "Agile methods are a response to more rigorous and traditional approaches to software development which are perceived to have failed both customers and software development practitioners. eXtreme Programming (XP) is an example an agile method and we report on an ethnographic study of XP practice carried out in a small company developing Web-based intelligent advertisements. We identify five characterising themes within XP practice and discuss these findings in terms of the culture and community of XP."
