title: "Using Formal Logic to Define the Grammar for Memory Transfer Language (MTL) on the mould of Register Transfer Language (RTL) and High Level Languages"
authors: [Leonard J. Mselle]
abstract: "This paper revisits visualization as a technique to enhance programming comprehension. It points out that
animation, being a machine-driven visualization, is inadequate. Memory Transfer Language (MTL), as a
visualization technique which is absolutely programmer-driven is demonstrated and discussed. It is shown
that MTL can be plugged into current materials for teaching programming. Register Transfer Language
(RTL) combined with high level languages are used as bedrocks on which MTL is formalized."
