title: "Modelling Software Organisations"
authors: [David Hales, Chris Douce]
abstract: "We view software construction as a social process embedded within organisational and cultural structures. To increase our understanding of the process of software construction we attempt to model not just individuals or teams but organisational wide processes. How can we begin to model such complex dynamic entitles composed of many interacting individuals? We outline our initial steps towards such an enterprise (employing multi-agent based simulation) and argue that this is a worthwhile endeavour if we are to increase our understanding of software production in the real world."
