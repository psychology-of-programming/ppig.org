title: "An agent for creative development in drum kit playing"
authors: [Noam Lederman, Simon Holland, Paul Mulholland]
abstract: "The aim of this research is to design, implement and evaluate a conversational agent for drum kit players
using a call and response model in order to develop their own drumming vocabulary and creativity.
Evaluation of the system and analysis of resulting expert drummer behaviour will be used to illuminate
various factors: the process of vocabulary development in drum kit players; ways in which technology
can assist drum kit players to achieve their creative goals, and more broadly how this approach could
support the practices of professional drummers. Although previous research has been conducted in
music computing focusing on creativity development in melodic instruments, for example, electronic
keyboard (Addessi, 2014) and guitar (Manaris et al., 2011), little is known whether this approach can
be applied in rhythmic instruments such as the drum kit. Therefore, the main contribution to knowledge
is exploring a gap in human-computer interaction tools for creativity development in drum kit playing."
