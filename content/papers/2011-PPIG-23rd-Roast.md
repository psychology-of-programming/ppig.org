title: "The programming-like-analysis of an innovative media tool"
authors: [Chris Roast, Elizabeth Uruchurtu, Andy Dearden]
abstract: "This paper describes a case study in which evaluation techniques have been developed and applied to
a novel commercially developed tool for supporting efficiency and effectiveness of a digital film
production processes. The tool is based upon a familiar concept in digital publishing that of separating
style from content, and as such, it represents a challenge for intended end users since it moves them
away from traditional working practices and towards programming-like-activity. Two alternative user
interfaces have been developed following a commercial development route. Approaches to analyzing
the effectiveness of the tool and its interfaces prior to its widespread adoption are described and the
conclusions from this analysis are illustrated and discussed."
