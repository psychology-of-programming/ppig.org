title: "A Study of Visualization in Introductory Programming"
authors: [Jussi Kasurinen, Mika Purmonen, Uolevi Nikula]
abstract: "The teaching of fundamental programming skills is a field that extensively uses different kinds of
tools to enhance learning experience. These tools come in several sizes, offering wide range of
different equipment or approaches to the teaching of introductory programming curricula. At the same
time, computer sciences, and programming courses in particular, suffer from high drop-out rates and
falling student grades. Students lose interest on programming because of several complex models and
structures have to be learned before anything visually impressive can be created. This problem is
intensified by the new multimedia environments like games and applets, whereas command line
programs and data algorithms have lost impact and are not considered interesting. So can visualization
tools be used to increase the student motivation and create motivational tasks to promote interest
towards programming?
<br>
This paper describes a project to enhance student motivation and interest towards programming in
the introductory programming course by applying visualization tool to lecture demonstrations and to
the course assignments. We present the results from the course and observed student reactions to
introduction of a visualization application. Finally we discuss the impact of the visual demonstrations
and project assignments from the motivational point of view, and present future improvement plans
and observations based on the results of the development project and course outcome."
