title: "Work in Progress Report: Nonvisual Visual Programming"
authors: [Clayton Lewis]
abstract: "Visual programming systems are widely used to introduce children and other learners to
programming, but they cannot be used by blind people. Inspired by the ideas of blind computer
scientist T.V.Raman, the Noodle system provides nonvisual access to a dataflow programming
system, a popular model for visual programming systems. This paper describes the design and
implementation of Noodle and some of its capabilities. The paper suggests that the same approach
used to develop Noodle could be applied to increase the accessibility of other visual programming
systems for learners with disabilities."
