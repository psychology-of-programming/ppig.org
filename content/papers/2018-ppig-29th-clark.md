title: "On Continuing Creativity"
authors: [Colin Clark, Sepideh Shahi]
abstract: "For decades, the software industry has struggled with change, continually devising new methods to better control and manage the risk to software development projects. This paper attempts to reconsider change as a positive force that can produce better, more resilient software. It argues for providing “users” with greater creative influence throughout the design process, as co-designers; and to support them with material software tools that will allow them to enact unanticipated changes after design is complete."
