title: "API Usability at Scale"
authors: [Andrew Macvean, Luke Church, John Daughtry, Craig Citro]
abstract: "Designing and maintaining useful and usable APIs remains challenging. At Google, we manage hundreds
of externally visible web APIs. Here, we report on our experiences and describe six on-going
challenges: resource allocation, empirically-grounded guidelines, communicating issues, supporting
API evolution over time, usable auth, and usable client libraries at scale."
