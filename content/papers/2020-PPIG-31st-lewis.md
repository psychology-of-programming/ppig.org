title: "On personality testing and software engineering"
authors: [Clayton Lewis]
abstract: "There is current interest in applying methods from the psychology of personality to software engineering. We are skeptical that the psychometric methods the authors advocate can usefully be applied in software engineering. Further, we see the potential for substantial harm from efforts to apply them."
