title: "Threshold for the Introduction of Programming: Providing Learners with a Simple Computer Model"
authors: [Joseph T. Khalife]
abstract: "Computer programming learning/teaching has been an active research
area in computer science and engineering. The difficulty level of the
teaching/learning process that novices in computer programming report is
three-fold, lack of problem solving strategies, misconceptions of code syntax
and semantics, and inability to develop an adequate mental model of the machine.
This paper examines major difficulties encountered by students taking
introductory-level programming courses and it proposes a computer model that
sets thresholds for defining basic programming concepts. The study’s initial
findings suggest that the adoption of the model succeeded significantly in improving
students’ academic achievement and perception of computer programming."
