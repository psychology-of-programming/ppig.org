title: "Scientists and software engineers: a tale of two cultures"
authors: [Judith Segal]
abstract: "The two cultures of the title are those observed in my field studies: the culture of scientists (financial
mathematicians, earth and planetary scientists, and molecular biologists) developing their own
software, and the culture of software engineers developing scientific software. In this paper, I shall
describe some problems arising when scientists and software engineers come together to develop
scientific software and discuss how these problems may be ascribed to their two different cultures."
