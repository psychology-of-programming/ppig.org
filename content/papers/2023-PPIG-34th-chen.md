title: "User-Centric Study and Enhancement of Python Static Code Analysers"
authors: [Steven Chen, Emma SÃ¶derberg, Alan McCabe]
abstract: "Despite the growing integration of code analysis tools into developer workflows, usability challenges
persist in many aspects. Previous research, primarily focused on static languages and professional developers,
has largely overlooked the needs of novice developers and non-static languages like Python.
In this paper, we investigate the experiences of novice Python programmers with static code analysis
tools. We aim to understand how these novices interact with and perceive these tools, with a focus on
identifying usability pain points. To this end, we conducted initial user research with a survey followed
by interviews. The insights derived from these studies were used to develop an enhanced version of the
Pylint extension to Visual Studio Code, incorporating additional quick-fixes to improve the user experience
connected to configuration of static analysis tools. The developed prototype extension was finally
evaluated in a user study. The results from the interviews and surveys suggest that false positives, otherwise
reported as a dominant cause of usability issues with code analysis, may not be as dominant for
novice users who may focus on other aspects and not challenge the code analysis results. In addition,
the results from the evaluation give early input on one possible direction for an enhanced Python code
analyser interaction focused on novices."
