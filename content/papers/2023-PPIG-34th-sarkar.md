abstract: "Generative AI, such as image generation models and large language models, stands to provide tremendous
value to end-user programmers in creative and knowledge workflows. Current research methods
struggle to engage end-users in a realistic conversation that balances the actually existing capabilities of
generative AI with the open-ended nature of user workflows and the many opportunities for the application
of this technology. In this work-in-progress paper, we introduce participatory prompting, a method
for eliciting opportunities for generative AI in end-user workflows. The participatory prompting method
combines a contextual inquiry and a researcher-mediated interaction with a generative model, which
helps study participants interact with a generative model without having to develop prompting strategies
of their own. We discuss the ongoing development of a study whose aim will be to identify end-user
programming opportunities for generative AI in data analysis workflows."
