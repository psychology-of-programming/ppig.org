title: "The Stores Model of Code Cognition"
authors: [Christopher Douce]
abstract: "Program comprehension is perhaps one of the oldest topics within the psychology of programming. It
addresses a central issue: how programmers work with and manipulate source code to construct
effective software systems. Models can play an important role in understanding the challenges
developers and engineers contend with. This paper presents a model of program comprehension, or
code cognition, which has been derived from literature found within the disciplines of computing and
psychology. Drawing on direct experimentation, this paper argues that a model of code cognition
should take account of the visual, spatial and linguistic abilities of developers. The strengths and
weaknesses of this model are discussed and further research directions presented."
