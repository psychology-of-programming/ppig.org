title: "Children’s Storytelling and Coding: Literature Review and Future Potential"
authors: [Rob Thompson, Steve Tanimoto]
abstract: "Children are now learning programming as early as in primary school or even earlier. The various programming constructs and patterns of use involved in coding require different levels of cognitive development, and young children are not ready to tackle all levels yet. It is well known that some aspects of programming are accessible to young children. We suggest that even more aspects may be accessible through the use of storytelling. In the course of this discussion, we survey literature relevant to the question of how storytelling and teaching programming can be mutually supporting. Then we describe relationships between six forms of programming and five levels of narrative development. Finally, we discuss three prominent issues regarding children’s coding and storytelling."
