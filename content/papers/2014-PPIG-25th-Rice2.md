title: "Concept Vocabularies in Programmer Sociolects (Work in Progress)"
authors: [J. E. Rice, B. Ellert, I. Genee, F. TÃ¤iani, and P. Rayson]
abstract: "The code a programmer writes plays a key role in communicating the intent and pur-
pose of that code. However little is known about how this process is influenced by sociological
factors. Does a programmer's background, experience, or even gender affect how they write com-
puter programs? Understanding this may offer valuable information to software developers and
educators. In this initial phase of research we focus on experience and writing, while upcoming
phases will incorporate reading and comprehension. In this paper we discuss an early experiment
looking at how years of programming experience might influence identifier formation."
