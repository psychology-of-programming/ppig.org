title: "Learning Programming by using Memory Transfer Language (MTL) without the Intervention of an Instructor"
authors: [Leonard J. Mselle]
abstract: "Visualization as a technique used to teach programming is gaining momentum. Memory Transfer Language (MTL) is a programmer-driven visualizer used to learn programming. This article reports on results obtained from a class experiment where MTL was used by non-novices to learn programming. The experiment was carried out to test the effectiveness of MTL in assisting students to learn programming (in a second language) without the intervention of a teacher. Results between the experimental and control group revealed that the group that studied programming using MTL without teachersâ€™ intervention performed better than the group that studied programming using conventional approach."
