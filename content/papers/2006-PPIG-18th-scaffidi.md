title: "Challenges, Motivations, and Success Factors in the Creation of Hurricane Katrina “Person Locator” Web Sites"
authors: [Christopher Scaffidi, Brad Myers, Mary Shaw]
abstract: "We interviewed six people who led teams that created web sites enabling
Hurricane Katrina survivors to report their status. We learned that interviewees
did not discover and communicate with other teams when they started
their projects, which resulted in redundant sites. The absence of a shared task
impeded trust between teams, ultimately inhibiting data collection and aggregation.
Moreover, communication within teams was problematic; developers who
had adequate technical skills to work alone were more positive about their
sites’ success compared to developers who had to shore up skill weaknesses
through collaboration. These problems did not simply result from team leaders’
over-sized egos, since site creators were generally motivated by concern for
other people instead of self-interested motivations. Rather, these problems
highlight the need for improved development methods and systems to help developers
discover and communicate with other teams’ leaders in order to collaborate
on widely distributed, time-critical projects."
