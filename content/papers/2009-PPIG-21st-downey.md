title: "Software Architects: A Different Type of Software Practitioner"
authors: [Jack Downey]
abstract: "This paper reports on two studies into the skills required to develop software. In the first, senior
software practitioners in four companies, across seven roles were interviewed. However, the architect
role proved difficult to characterize, because architects did not seem to carry out any architecture
work. It was hypothesized that this was because the five architects interviewed were all working on
mature products. In a second study, five senior architects in a single company were interviewed and
the realisation from this study is that, unlike most other software practitioners, architects are not so
much project focussed as product and market focussed. This discovery suggests that focussing the
interviews on projects rather than on products is inappropriate for architects."
