title: "A Course Dedicated to Developing Algorithmic Problem-Solving Skills â€“ Design and Experiment"
authors: [Orna Muller, Bruria Haberman]
abstract: "Undergraduate students often start their academic course of studies with inadequate learning and
thinking skills. Our college has a policy of setting high standards and demands, while supporting
students' learning in a variety of ways. In this paper we present a distinctive course designed to aid
students develop algorithmic problem-solving skills. The course is taught in parallel to a CS1 course
and elaborates on activities such as analogical reasoning, prototyping problems, comparison between
alternative solutions and reflection on problem-solving processes. It is one of the courses offered at
our institution aimed at strengthening general learning and thinking skills, in addition to the regular
disciplinary curriculum. Feedback from participants in the course demonstrates a developed
awareness and appreciation of abstract ideas beyond programming knowledge. Students report on
acquiring problem-solving skills that enable them to cope with compound problems. Additionally,
students claimed that they had broadened their repertoire of algorithmic ideas leading to more
efficient and elegant solutions."
