title: "Analysing Open Source Software to Better Understand Long Term Memory Structures in the Human Brain"
authors: [Thomas Mullen]
abstract: "As AI models become larger, replicating long term memory structures (LTM-S) may produce the same benefits that evolution provided the human brain (efficiency, performance, and extensibility).
<br>
At the heart of this paper is the conjecture that software structures are close representations of LTM-S. If this is true, then open source can be considered a huge database of easily searchable LTM-S examples that could assist in a deeper understanding of the same.
<br>
The paper proposes a general refactoring algorithm based around two elements of LTM-S, chunks and analogies. The underlying aim is to develop mechanisms and theories to analyse the analogical and chunking structures employed in software."
