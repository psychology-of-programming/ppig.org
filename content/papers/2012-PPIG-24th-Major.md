title: "Teaching Novices Programming Using a Robot Simulator: Case Study Protocol"
authors: [Louis Major, Theocharis Kyriacou, Pearl Brereton]
abstract: "This protocol provides details of a case study design that will investigate the use of simulated robots as introductory programming teaching tools. This research is motivated by the results of a Systematic Literature Review which indicated that such work would be valuable. The protocol will help to ensure that a reliable, transparent and rigorous study is performed. Furthermore, potential problems have been considered and accounted for in advance of its implementation. The protocol may also act as a point of reference for other researchers interested in performing a case study."
