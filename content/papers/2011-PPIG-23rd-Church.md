title: "Why PPIG matters beyond the P"
authors: [Luke Church]
abstract: "Initially, one might think that Psychology of Programming mainly had things to say about
professional programmers. People who sit behind desks, writing software and having meetings all day
long.
<br>
It certainly is about these people, but it turns out that the techniques are also useful in dealing with a
host of other issues. From performing arts to security, politics to economics - techniques that were
developed for studying programmers are finding applications, and being improved in the process."
