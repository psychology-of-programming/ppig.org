title: "Learning Syntax as Notational Expertise when using DrawBridge"
authors: [Alistair Stead, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "We report an experiment that explores the classroom application of DrawBridge, a system designed to
support the acquisition of skill in using text-based programming language syntax. Graphical syntax is
increasingly popular in educational programming languages such as Scratch, but anecdotal reports
from classroom teachers suggest that students are now finding it difficult to make the transition to
conventional text syntax. This research investigates text syntax use as a specific notational
competence, and evaluates the use of DrawBridge to scaffold text syntax acquisition."
