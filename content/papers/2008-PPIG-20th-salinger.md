title: "What happens during Pair Programming?"
authors: [Stephan Salinger, Lutz Prechelt]
abstract: "Successful qualitative analysis of pair programming requires a terminology (such as a
set of concepts or a coding scheme) that represents the observed phenomena on an appropriate
abstraction level. On the one hand, different analysis goals will require different specialized terminology,
on the other hand it would be helpful, if different studies used common terminology so that
comparing and combining their results will be easier. We suggest to define terminology in layers:
a PP foundation layer that is common to all analyses and more specialized study-specific layers
on top. The present article presents this foundation layer which we have derived from audio/video
analysis of pair programming sessions in Grounded Theory investigation style. Its concepts describe
the individual observable human-to-human utterances and human-to-computer activities that occur
during pair programming."
