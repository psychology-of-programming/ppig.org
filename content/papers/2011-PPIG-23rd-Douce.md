title: "Understanding program complexity: an approach for study"
authors: [Christopher Douce, Szonya Durant]
abstract: "This short work in progress paper presents a series of experiments that are intended to explore two
related research questions. The first research question is whether software complexity metrics have a
cognitive basis or are ‘real’ in a psychological sense. The second research question aims to explore in
greater detail how programmer memory may relate to measures of spatial software complexity. A
small number of metrics are described, followed by a description of two different experiments which
are continuing to be designed."
