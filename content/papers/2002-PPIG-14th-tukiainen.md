title: "Programming aptitude testing as a prediction of learning to program"
authors: [Markku Tukiainen, Eero Mönkkönen]
abstract: "Identifying variables that predict programming aptitude may help educators and employers select potential students and employees. The local polytechnic school wanted to have a test that would predict success in learning programming concepts. In this paper we present an empirical study that attempts to evaluate how predictive the developed testing of programming aptitude was."
