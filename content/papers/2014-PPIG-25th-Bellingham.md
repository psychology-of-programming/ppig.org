title: "A Cognitive Dimensions analysis of interaction design for algorithmic composition software"
authors: [Matt Bellingham, Simon Holland, Paul Mulholland]
abstract: "This paper presents an analysis of the user interfaces of a range of algorithmic music composition
software using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations as the main analysis tool. Findings include the
following: much of the reviewed software exhibits a low viscosity and requires significant user
knowledge. The use of metaphor (staff notation, music production hardware) introduces multiple
levels of abstraction which the user has to understand in order to use effectively: some instances of
close mapping reduce abstraction but require the user to do more work. Significant premature
commitment is not conducive to music composition, and there are clear opportunities for the greater
provisionality that a piece of structurally-aware music software could provide. Visibility and
juxtaposability are frequently compromised by complex design. Patching software reduces the hard
mental operations required of the user by making the signal flow clear, although graphical complexity
can have a negative impact on role-expressiveness. Complexity leads to error-proneness in several
instances, although there are some tools (such as error-checking and auto-completion) which seek to
ameliorate the main problems."
