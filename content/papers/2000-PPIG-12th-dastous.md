title: "On the use of functional and interactional approaches for the analysis of technical review meetings"
authors: [Patrick d'Astous, Françoise Détienne, Willemien Visser, Pierre N. Robillard]
abstract: "The object of this paper is to propose and illustrate two complementary approaches to analyse team design activities: a functional and an interactional approach. The functional approach examines how collective design proceeds from the viewpoint of actions and objects. The analyses conducted under the interactional approach concern argumentation and participant roles (and their interaction). Both of these approaches are illustrated by a study of technical review meetings of a software development project. Implications of our results for tools are discussed."
