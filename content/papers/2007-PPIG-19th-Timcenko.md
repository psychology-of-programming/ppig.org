title: "Example of Using Narratives in Teaching Programming: Roles of Variables"
authors: [Olga Timcenko]
abstract: "This paper describes a case study of using narratives to motivate nontechnology
inclined children, 11-15 years old, to learn programming, using
LEGO Mindstorms robots and RoboLab graphical programming language.
Case study was done during 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 school years, following
two different school teams participating in FIRST LEGO League competitions.
Using narrative concept and a concept of roles of variables, it was possible to
explain several searching and sorting algorithms to children, including an
algorithm of finding minimal/maximal value from the set of input values.
Results are encouraging and could be generalized to other programming
languages but RoboLab."
