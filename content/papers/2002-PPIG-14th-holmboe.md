title: "Revitalising Old Thoughts: Class diagrams in light of the early Wittgenstein"
authors: [Christian Holmboe]
abstract: "The early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein aimed at outlining a set of postulates about the use of language to describe the world. This work bears a remarkable resemblance to the methodologies developed for data modelling. This paper discusses the features and constraints of object-oriented data modelling with UML class diagrams in light of the early theories developed by Wittgenstein and first published in 1921. The later criticism towards this theory illustrates some of the limitations of class diagrams as a language for describing the world."
