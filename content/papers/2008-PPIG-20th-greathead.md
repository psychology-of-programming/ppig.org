title: "MBTI Personality Type and Student Code Comprehension Skill"
authors: [David Greathead]
abstract: "This study aimed to examine the skill of participants in understanding the functioning of a piece of
Java code by reading it. Their skill at this task was measured via a code comprehension task. The aim
was to ascertain any relationships between this skill and their personality as measured by the Myers
Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).
<br>
The study was carried out with 74 participants, all of whom were from a computing science
background and were of undergraduate, postgraduate or postdoctoral level, the majority being
undergraduate students.
<br>
It was discovered that there was one significant interaction between personality as measured by the
MBTI and code comprehension skill. Individuals who had a leaning towards Introversion on the
Extroversion/Introversion preference were significantly better at the code comprehension task. None
of the other three MBTI preferences yielded a significant result. This is discussed in the context of
previous research."
