title: "Investigating the role of programmersâ€™ peripheral vision: a gaze-contingent tool and an experiment proposal"
authors: [Roman Bednarik, Paul A. Orlov]
abstract: "Previous research of visual attention in programming has shown differences in how expert and novice programmers attend to the available information. What has not been yet sufficiently investigated is the degree with which the information is sampled by the peripheral vision during programming. Such issues have been investigated by a contingent-window paradigm in other domains and we have thus developed a tool allowing such studies in programming. In this paper, we introduce the tool and a proposal for an experiment we plan to conduct."
