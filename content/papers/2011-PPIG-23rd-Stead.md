title: "User Configurable Machine Vision for Mobiles"
authors: [Alistair G. Stead]
abstract: "We describe efforts to evaluate a new smartphone-based visual programming language, which gives
users the ability to map their own musical blob notation to synthesized audio. We use the Cognitive
Dimensions of Notations questionnaire (Blackwell & Green, 2000) to gain qualitative feedback, and
use traditional observation methods to support our results. Using this methodology, we were able to
find that musical and non-musical users both react positively to the system, with no marked difference
between the two groups."
