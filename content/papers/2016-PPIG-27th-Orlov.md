title: "Programmers’ experiences with working in the restricted-view mode as indications of parafoveal processing differences."

abstract: "Understanding of programmers’ attention provides benefits for developing comprehension models, bugprediction
models, for increasing software productivity, and facilitating programming education activities.
Here we conduct a gaze-contingent study involving a real-time restriction of the viewing area
and compare professionals’ and novices’ verbal feedback after the parafoveal view was restricted during
source-code comprehension. Such information provides clues about the differences in parafoveal
processing during programming.
<br>
We recorded the participants’ verbal feedback and divided their answers into seven topics and types.
Then we analysed the differences between the answers given by the experts and the novices. We compared
the proportion of utterances used to comment upon a certain topic by each group. This allowed
to identify the relative importance of a particular topic. Some topics turned out equally important for
both the experts and the novices: 1. analysis of the working process, 2. personal evaluation of the
source code, and 3. the use of life-hacks. The experts and the novices used a different proportion of
utterances to comment upon the experimental conditions and visualizing, which was unexpected. The
restriction of the extrafoveal area evoked a more emotional response from the expert programmers. At
the same time, the novices perceived the restriction of semantic information in the extrafoveal area in a
less emotional way. We suggest that the explanation is that the experts have increased expectations for
the information to be obtained from the attentional objects located in the extrafoveal area. The masking
of parafoveal objects makes them less easily available, which runs counter to the experts’ expectations
and, therefore, produces a stronger emotional feedback. This illustrates that it is a common thing for
expert programmers to use the parafoveal information during source code comprehension."
