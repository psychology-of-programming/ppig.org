title: "A fox not a hedgehog: What does PPIG know?"
authors: [Luke Church, Mariana Mărășoiu]
abstract: "We outline a thematic history of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group based on a coding of
[~400] publications. We highlight the changing interests of the community, draw out trends and
discuss missing topics. We compare and contrast with [~50] publications from the PLATEAU
community. We find that, foxlike,
PPIG has a very broad coverage of a wide range of topics. We
characterise trends in these and go on to discuss missing topics and areas for future work."
