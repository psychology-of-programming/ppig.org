title: "Work in Progress: A Nonvisual Interface for a Blocks Language"
authors: [Varsha Koushik, Clayton Lewis]
abstract: "Visual programming systems, including blocks languages like Scratch (Maloney et al., 2010) are
widely used to introduce children and other learners to programming, but in their present form they
cannot be used by blind people. Following up work on the nonvisual dataflow language Noodle
(Lewis, 2014), and building on the Blockly language system (https://developers.google.com/blockly/;
Fraser, 2015) we are building a nonvisual interface to a blocks language. We present a pseudospatial
interface for the language, similar to that of Noodle, and compare it with other approaches to
accessibility for blocks languages."
