title: "Enhancing user-centredness in agile teams: A study on programmer’s values for a better understanding on how to position usability methods in XP"
authors: [Michael Leitner, Peter Wolkerstorfer, Arjan Geven, Manfred Tscheligi]
abstract: "We present a study on programmer’s high-level goals in eXtreme Programming settings (XP). We
talked to 10 programmers using so-called “laddering interviews”. The result presented is a
“Hierarchical Value Map (HVM)” indicating agile programmer’s high-level goals. This study was
done to better orchestrate usability methods and integrate them into agile development processes. The
study’s results were used to position and adapt usability methods in a way that they are better aligned
to the programmer’s goals and therefore are more likely to be accepted. We draw conclusions on the
basis of the study’s results and experiences using agile usability methods in practise."
