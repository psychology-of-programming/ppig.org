title: "Designing a Programming Language for Home Automation"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell, Rob Hague]
abstract: "The AutoHAN project at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory is developing a range of technologies related to next-generation home networking and automation. Several aspects of the project involve the development of programming languages suitable for use in the home. Languages of this sort will clearly have a significant impact on the usability of domestic electronic devices, and greatly broaden the range of users who might benefit from psychology of programming research. As yet, the design of the AutoHAN languages is not complete. This paper therefore describes the design process and design criteria that have been applied so far. This is as a basis for discussion at this workshop, and for planning of further psychology of programming research related to the AutoHAN programme."
