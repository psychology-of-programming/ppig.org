title: "Exploring Teachers’ Perspectives on Navigating Recursion Pedagogies"
authors: [Jude Nzemeke, Marjahan Begum, Jo Wood]
abstract: "Recursion is a fundamental and powerful concept in algorithm design and programming. While
invaluable for solving complex problems such as tree traversal and permutation generation, recursion
presents challenges for students who often struggle with comprehension, tracing recursive calls, and
devising efficient solutions. This study investigates teachers’ pedagogical and instructional strategies
for teaching recursion, as well as effective assessment techniques. It explores the order in which
programming concepts, such as iteration, selection, sequencing, recursion, and object-oriented
programming (OOP) are taught in relation to how well students understand the concepts. It highlights
the significance of the instructional sequence of these concepts, and reveals that, contrary to the
advocated early teaching approach by some researchers – for example, teaching recursion first before
iteration – recursion is mainly introduced last to students and is perceived by most of the surveyed
teachers as the most challenging concept for students to learn. Teachers’ perceptions of the difficulty in
teaching these concepts were also explored. Programming Assignments and Coding Challenges are
found to be the most popular and effective assessment methods for recursion. The study advocates for
an integrated teaching approach that combines tangible objects (e.g., boxes and envelopes) and visual
aids (diagrams and animations) to enhance student engagement and understanding during recursion
instruction. This multi-sensory approach caters to diverse learning styles and preferences among
students, offering a strategy for addressing the challenges associated with teaching recursion."
