title: "Computer Anxiety and the Big Five"
authors: [Sarah J Crabbe, Peter Andras]
abstract: "This paper explores the relationship between personality traits, as described by the Big Five Factors model, and the likelihood of someone suffering from computer anxiety. The research sample was a cohort of Business School Undergraduates. It was found that for this sample there was a small but significant correlation between two of the traits, agreeableness and emotional stability, and computer anxiety."
