title: "Bricolage Programming in the Creative Arts"
authors: [Alex McLean, Geraint Wiggins]
abstract: "In this paper we consider artists who create their work by writing algorithms, which
when interpreted by a computer generates their plotted drawings, synthesised music, animated
digital video, or whatever target medium they have chosen. We examine the demands that such
artists place upon their environments, the relationships between concepts and algorithms, and of
cognition and computation. We begin by considering an artist's creative process, and situating
it within the bricolage style of programming. An embodied view of bricolage programming is
related, underpinned by theories of cognitive metaphor and computational creativity, and finally
with consideration of the bricolage programmer's relation to time."
