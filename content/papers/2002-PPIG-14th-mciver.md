title: "Evaluating Languages and Environments for Novice Programmers"
authors: [Linda McIver]
abstract: "Although debate rages strongly over which programming language is the best for any particular application (especially for teaching introductory programming), there is a lack of objective data informing the discussions. There is a similar lack of data on appropriate development environments for introductory programming courses. This paper discusses an existing method of comparing and evaluating programming languages, and how that method can be adapted to compare and evaluate integrated development environments, with a particular focus on environments for novice programmers."
