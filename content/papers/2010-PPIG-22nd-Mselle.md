title: "Enhancing Comprehension by Using Random Access Memory (RAM) Diagrams in Teaching Programming: Class Experiment"
authors: [Leonard J. Mselle]
abstract: "This paper presents results of an experiment in which Random Access Memory (RAM) diagrams
were used to teach novice students C programming. Students were divided into two groups that were
differently instructed. The control group was instructed in the traditional way while the experiment
group was instructed with the aid of RAM diagrams employed throughout the course. Examination
results from the two groups were compared. Statistical analysis was done and the Z value was
calculated. The results suggest that the use of RAM diagrams improves programming comprehension
and programming skills."
