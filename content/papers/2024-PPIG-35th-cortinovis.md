title: "Further Evaluations of a Didactic CPU Visual Simulator (CPUVSIM)"
authors: [Renato Cortinovis, Tamer Mohamed Abdellatif, Devender Goyal, Luiz Fernando Capretz]
abstract: "This paper discusses further evaluations of the educational effectiveness of an existing CPU visual
simulator (CPUVSIM). The CPUVSIM, as an Open Educational Resource, has been iteratively
improved over a number of years following an Open Pedagogy approach, and was designed to enhance
novicesâ€™ understanding of computer operation and mapping from high-level code to assembly language.
The literature reports previous evaluations of the simulator, at K12 and undergraduate level, conducted
from the perspectives of both developers and students, albeit with a limited sample size and primarily
through qualitative methods. This paper describes additional evaluation activities designed to provide
a more comprehensive assessment, across diverse educational settings: an action research pilot study
recently carried out in Singapore and the planning of a more quantitative-oriented study in Dubai, with
a larger sample size. Results from the pilot study in Singapore confirm the effectiveness and high level
of appreciation of the tool, alongside a few identified challenges, which inform the planning of the more
comprehensive evaluation in Dubai.s"
