title: "An Investigation Into Strategies Employed In Solving A Programming Task Using Prolog"
authors: [J. Siddiqi, B. Khazaei, R. Osborn, C. Roast]
abstract: "This paper highlights the carry over effects in changing from a procedural to a declarative approach. The results of a case study into programming in Prolog for a relatively simple problem is reported. This paper describes the different methods of solutions that these subjects used to solve the problem and argues that they can be explained on the bases of strategies used for problem decomposition and the choice of data representation. It argues that the methods of solutions used suffer from a \"carry over effect\" based on a procedural approach. In particular, that the choice of data representation used appears to be more important than the parudigm used."
