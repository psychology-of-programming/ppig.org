title: "Introducing Learning into Automatic Program Comprehension"
authors: [Petri M. Gerdt, Jorma Sajaniemi]
abstract: "Automatic program comprehension applications, which try
to extract programming knowledge from program code, share many features
of human program comprehension models. However, the human
trait of learning seems to be missing among the shared features. We
present an approach to integrate machine learning techniques into automatic
program comprehension, and present an example implementation
in the context of automatic analysis of roles of variables."
