title: "The Misplaced Comma: Programmers’ Tales and Traditions"
authors: [Lindsay Marshall, Jim Webber]
abstract: "Programmers do not exist in isolation and there is communication between them about the technical aspects of their work. Sometimes this takes the form of stories and anecdotes and this paper suggests that study of these programmers’ tales and how they spread could provide useful insights into how programmers perceive their work."
