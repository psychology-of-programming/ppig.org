title: "Work In Progress Report: Tracking the Novice Programmer"
authors: [J. Thomas Allen, Temi Bidjerano]
abstract: "Computer science educators agree that, for many beginners, learning to write computer programs is
very difficult. And, in spite of our best efforts at remedying the situation, many novice programmers
still struggle. We report some preliminary findings from our study that seeks to understand what sort
of preconceptions novices use when learning to program. Our early results show unsurprisingly that
student programmers can be separated distinctly into the haves and have-nots. This separation seems
based on mastery of programming skills that are likely developed in an incremental fashion that
suggests a hierarchy. But, in spite of these findings, we have also noted that predicting whether a
student can correct or debug a program does not seem to depend on their success in these other areas."
