title: "Little worlds with big implications: Software as miniature"
authors: [Luke Church, Mariana Marasoiu]
abstract: "Programming has a feel to it. Sometimes it feels light and airy, other times tangled and bureaucratic. The PPIG community, and others, have been trying to get at what's going on here for years. In this paper we suggest one more route in - though the world of miniatures.

We describe a phenomenological analogy between the doll's house and the software, adopting Tuan's lens of Dominance and Affection to describe the commonality. We then trace the difference in outcomes between what happens in a doll's house and a software program and make some suggestions as to what the implications are for the experience that programmers have."
