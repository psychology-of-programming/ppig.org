title: "Little worlds with big implications: Software as miniature"
authors: [Luke Church, Mariana Marasoiu]
abstract: "Programming has a feel to it. Sometimes it feels light and airy, other times tangled and bureaucratic. The PPIG community, and others, have been trying to get at what's going on here for years. In this paper we suggest one more route in.

Tuan's lens of Dominance and Affection describes how owners regard their pets. The same ideas extend to the doll’s house, and often extend to the software and tools used to build it. By comparing what happens in a doll’s house and a software program we make some suggestions as to what the implications are for the experience that programmers have and for the tools they use."
