title: "EPSRC and support for the Psychology of Programming"
authors: [Nigel Birch]
abstract: "Responsibility for the Psychology of Programming rests within the Human Factors sector of the IT & Computer Science Programme of EPSRC. This sector has been under review over the last few months with the intention of drawing out, across its remit, the priorities for research within the fields it covers.
<br>
Final decisions have yet to be made, in terms of EPSRCâ€™s response to the recommendations that have emerged from the review. However, the comments on the psychology of programming that will be incorporated into the report from the exercise will be presented. Participants will be invited to comments on the suggestions."
