title: "Computer Programming for Noughts-and-Crosses: New Frontiers"
authors: [W.M. Beynon, M.S. Joy]
abstract: "We relate the development of computer programs that play variants of noughts-and-crosses to an analysis of the perception and action involved in human play. We outline the construction of a computer model, expressed as a script of definitions, within which the perceptions and actions of agents such as the players and observers can be recorded. We briefly compare and contrast our concept of agent-orientation with alternative approaches to agent-oriented programming."
