title: "Measurement and visualisation of software timing properties"
authors: [Nick Merriam, Andrew Howes]
abstract: "We observe that programmers in the hard, real-time domain experience severe dificulties when confronted with software timing problems. A number of different visualisations of timing
behaviour appear to have large benefits but the specific effects and their significance have not yet
been studied with any rigour. Rather than a report of proven results, this is a call for suggestions
and contributions to potential, future investigation of the phenomena involved."
