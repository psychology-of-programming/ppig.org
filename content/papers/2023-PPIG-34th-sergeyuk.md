abstract: "This paper adopts a cognitive psychology perspective to investigate the recurring mistakes in code resulting
from the mental set (Einstellung) effect. The Einstellung effect is the tendency to approach
problem-solving with a preconceived mindset, often overlooking better solutions that may be available.
This effect can significantly impact creative thinking, as the development of patterns of thought can
hinder the emergence of novel and creative ideas. Our study aims to test the Einstellung effect and the
two mechanisms of its overcoming in the field of programming. The first intervention was the change of
the color scheme of the code editor to the less habitual one. The second intervention was a combination
of instruction to “forget the previous solutions and tasks” and the change in the color scheme. During
the experiment, participants were given two sets of four programming tasks. Each task had two possible
solutions: one using suboptimal code dictated by the mental set, and the other using a less familiar but
more efficient and recommended methodology. Between the sets, participants either received no treatment
or one of two interventions aimed at helping them overcome the mental set. The results of our
experiment suggest that the tested techniques were insufficient to support overcoming the mental set,
which we attribute to the specificity of the programming domain. The study contributes to the existing
literature by providing insights into creativity support during problem-solving in software development
and offering a framework for experimental research in this field."
