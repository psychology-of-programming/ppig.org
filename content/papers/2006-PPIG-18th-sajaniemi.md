title: "Teaching Programming: Going beyond “Objects First”"
authors: [Jorma Sajaniemi, Chenglie Hu]
abstract: "The prevailing paradigm in teaching elementary programming
uses Java as the first programming language and the “objects
first” approach as the conceptual basis. This approach has several shortcomings,
e.g., high drop-out rates and poor skills in basic constructs
like loops. This paper suggests an alternative approach that combines
a strong start in basic constructs with early object-orientation. The
key idea of our approach is to start with concepts that are common
to both procedural and object-oriented programming, i.e., basic control
and data structures and a simple form of the interplay between responsibility
and implementation. Only then various abstraction mechanisms—
procedural, functional, object-oriented, and data as well as the interplay
between responsibility and implementation in these abstractions—will
be introduced. The alternative approach is also compared with the ACM
Computing Curricula."
