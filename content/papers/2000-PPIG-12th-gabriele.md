title: "Programmer education in Arts and Humanities Course Degree"
authors: [Lorella Gabriele, Francesca Pietramala]
abstract: "In this paper, we present some results of a questionnaire research made at the Arts and Humanities Faculty nearby University of Calabria. We have investigated if, in learning a programming language, students coming from a humanistic background differ from students having a scientific one. Furthermore, we tried to verify if students experienced some learning difficulties and if a potential reason of these difficulties could be attributed to their school background."
