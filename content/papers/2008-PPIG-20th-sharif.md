title: "Observing Open Source Programmers’ Information Seeking"
authors: [Khaironi Yatim Sharif, Jim Buckley]
abstract: "Several authors have proposed information seeking as an appropriate perspective for studying
software maintenance, and have characterized information seeking empirically in commercial
software evolution settings. This paper addresses the parallel issue of information seeking in Open
Source software evolution. Open Source software evolution exacerbates information-seeking
problems, as team members are typically delocalized from the other members of their team.

This paper employs an analysis schema from our previous study (Sharif et.al 2008), generated through
open-coding, to characterize information seeking in Open-Source, programmers’ mailing-lists, the
medium they predominantly use for communication. A preliminary study using this schema had
several interesting conclusions. Specifically, the analysis has shown that Open Source programmers
rely somewhat on documentation, that many of their information seeking activities are process
orientated and that their information seeking goals change over time."
