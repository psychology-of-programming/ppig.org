title: "The construction of knowledge about programs"
authors: [Federico Gómez, Sylvia da Rosa]
abstract: "This paper presents an empirical study that uses the linear search problem to investigate the process of construction of knowledge about programs.
<br>
The study was carried out in an introductory programming course of a Computer Engineering Undergraduate
Program, using two imperative programming languages (Pascal and C++) in two different
groups of students.
<br>
Building on the theory of Genetic Epistemology of Jean Piaget and his understanding of the construction
of scientic knowledge, the study applies Piaget’s principles of a triad of intra, inter and trans stages,
and the general law of cognition, in order to analyse the passage from the intra stage into the inter and
trans stages. The passage involves the actions students undertake as they design an algorithm to solve
the proposed problem, and the reections needed for them to implement and execute a program on a
computer.
<br>
The study describes several steps in which students carried out different activities. In order to encourage
them to conceptualise and formalise their solutions, individual interviews were conducted with thirteen
students, of approximately an hour each. The paper includes selected excerpts of students’ responses,
our analysis of the results, and some conclusions and future work."
