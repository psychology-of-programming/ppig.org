title: "H.I.D.E.: A Virtual Reality Debugging Environment"
authors: [Nicolas Slack, Kate Howland]
abstract: "This paper presents a prototype virtual reality debugging environment, aimed at novices, that provides a 3D visualisation of code and supports gestural navigation through the visualisation. This prototype is implemented for the HTC Vive, and has the capability to expand into a variety of 3D visualisations, programming languages, and VR platforms. We describe how our design builds on previous research on debugging to provide support for observing, exploring and hypothesizing activities by focusing on flow-of-control and data visualisations. We present preliminary results from pilot user testing and highlight key areas for future development."
