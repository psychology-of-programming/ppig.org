title: "Visualising Bayesian Probability in the Kalahari"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell, Nicola J. Bidwell, Helen L. Arnold, Charlie Nqeisji, /Kun Kunta, Martin Mabeifam Ujakpa]
abstract: "We describe an approach to interactive visualisation of conditional probability within a Bayesian framework, developed to explore the potential for end-user probabilistic programming languages to be used in educational contexts. We are specifically interested in a setting where there are both educational challenges and distinctive approaches to probabilistic reasoning, working with the Ju|â€™hoan people who live around the town of Tsumkwe, in the Namibian region of the Kalahari."
