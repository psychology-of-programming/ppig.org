title: "Comparing API Design Choices with Usability Studies: A Case Study and Future Directions"
authors: [Jeffrey Stylos, Steven Clarke, Brad Myers]
abstract: "There are more APIs than ever, and designing APIs that are usable by
their target audience is difficult. Work at Microsoft has demonstrated that running
controlled usability studies with participants from different personas and
analyzing the results of these studies using the cognitive dimensions framework
is effective at identifying and preventing usability problems in APIs. This paper
presents a generalization of that technique in the form of usability studies of
common API design choices. By studying a single design choice from multiple
perspectives, we can generalize our results to any API that might be affected by
the design choice. We show the feasibility of our approach with an initial study
on whether or not to require constructor parameters, and present our current
and planned work to study more API design choices."
