title: "Coding or AI? Tools for Control, Surprise and Creativity"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "This essay presents an argument, accessible to non-specialists, for creative tools that are conceived as
programming languages rather than as creative artificial intelligences (AI). The computational
implications of creative experience are explained (again, for non-specialists) in terms of fundamentals
of information theory. Using analogies to musical instruments, and drawing on recent advances in
generative large language models, the paper explains the potential of aleatoric and stochastic elements
in programming languages for live coding, and contrasts these with the opportunity for generative
language models to be incorporated in programming tools."
