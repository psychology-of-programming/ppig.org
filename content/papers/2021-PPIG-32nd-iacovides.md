title: "Neither Grasshopper nor Ant: learning from DIY coding and from gaming [WIP]"
authors: [Ioanna Iacovides and Thomas R.G. Green]
abstract: "‘DIY’ coding for fun and gaming have more in common than seems to have been noticed, both notationally (no abstractions, no juxtaposability, etc) and in the user experiences (challenge, breakdowns, breakthroughs). We argue that some familiar claims about end-user programming, such as a need for domain-specific languages, do not apply to DIY coding, and that lightweight optional features such as ‘abstraction by accretion’ could help both DIY coders and gamers when the project grew too big."
