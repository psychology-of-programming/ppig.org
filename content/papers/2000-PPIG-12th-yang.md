title: "How do people check polymorphic types?"
authors: [Yang Jun, Greg Michaelson, Phil Trinder]
abstract: "Polymorphic typechecking algorithms efficiently locate type errors in programs, but users find error reporting from such algorithms hard to comprehend. We are investigating the development of a new polymorphic type checker that reports type errors in a more understandable form. Here we present the results of experiments into human checking of both correct and incorrect polymorphic typed programs, and briefly discuss their implications for our proposed new checker."
