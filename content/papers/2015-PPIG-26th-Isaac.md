title: "Intuitive NUIs for Speech Editing of Structured Content (Work in Progress)"
authors: [Marina Isaac, Eckhard Pfl√ºgel, Gordon Hunter, James Denholm-Price]
abstract: "Improvements in automatic speech recognition, along with the growing popularity of
speech driven \"assistants\" in consumer electronics, indicate that this input modality will become
increasingly relevant. Although good functionality is offered for word processing applications, this
is not the case for highly structured content such as mathematical text or computer program code.
In this paper we combine the principles of natural user interfaces with the concept of intuitive
use, and adapt them for speech as the input modality in the context of editing content displayed
on a screen. The resulting principles are used to inform design of the user interface of a specialist
language editor for spoken mathematics."
