title: "A logical mind, not a programming mind: Psychology of a professional end-user"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell, Cecily Morrison]
abstract: "This paper reports a case study of a specific end-user programming context, in which an electronic
patient record system was being customised by a healthcare professional. Our research involved
making an unusual intervention, employing a professional programmer as a quasi-experimental
participant, in order to explore and contrast the different ways that the same situation was conceived
by an end-user programmer and by a professional programmer. We found a range of pragmatic
strategies that were employed by the end-user, causing her to resist some conventional views of how
programs and source code should be interpreted. Rather than different ‘cognitive styles’, we believe
these differing mental models can be accounted for by the context of the practical work the two need
to achieve, and the organisational contexts within which they work. We make some observations and
recommendations about the design of tools for end-user programmers, extrapolating from our in-depth
observation of one particular product."
