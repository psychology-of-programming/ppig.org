title: "The Object Relational impedance mismatch from a cognitive point of view"
authors: [Laura Benvenuti, Gerrit C. van der Veer]
abstract: "Computer Science has evolved towards a discipline with different branches. Scholars study and define
artefacts from different viewpoints: computer languages, environments, paradigms. Practitioners work
in multidisciplinary teams. They design, produce and link software that was designed according to
different paradigms. We are interested in the communication between these practitioners. Do they
refer to the same concepts when they use the same words? We designed an experiment to assess this."
