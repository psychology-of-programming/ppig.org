title: "Sketching by Programming in the Choreographic Language Agent"
authors: [Luke Church, Nick Rothwell, Marc Downie, Scott DeLahunta, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "We describe the Choreographic Language Agent, a programming environment designed for use by
dancers and choreographers in the context of improvisatory composition methods. CLA provides a
means for dancers to interact with a simple but powerful set of 3D geometric transforms, creating a
wide variety of kinematic and dynamic configurations expressed in the form of phrases. These phrases
can be composed in a dynamic visual arrangement, offering sophisticated facilities for provisionality
and version control. Direct interaction with a live 3D rendering is a key feature of the system,
although this rendering is only an intermediate product, designed to offer ample space for alternative
interpretations when mapped onto dance movement. The result is a programming language that
emphasises transience, ambiguity and creative flow rather than the conventional requirements of
professional software engineering contexts."
