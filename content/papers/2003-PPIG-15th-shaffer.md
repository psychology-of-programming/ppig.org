title: "Applying Cognitive Load Theory to Computer Science Education"
authors: [Dale Shaffer, Wendy Doube, Juhani Tuovinen]
abstract: "Cognitive Load Theory provides a theoretical basis for understanding the learning process. It uses an information processing model to describe how the mind acquires and stores knowledge, and to provide an explanation for the limitations imposed by working memory.
