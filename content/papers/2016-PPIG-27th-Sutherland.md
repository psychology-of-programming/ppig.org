title: "Location, Location, Location: Using Spatial Memory in an Integrated Development Environments to Assist Program Code Comprehension? (Work in Progress)"
authors: [Craig Sutherland, Andrew Luton-Reilly, Beryl Plimmer]
abstract: "An important task while reading program code is finding the location of relevant sections. When reading non-code documents, readers often rely on spatial memory and indications of the document hierarchy inherent in headings to build up an understanding. However, documents involving code are structured in a non-linear way, without the benefit of headings. Using the results from an observational study, we describe a tool that uses spatial memory for finding previously read sections of code. We propose that this tool will reduce the amount of time spent navigating through code and thus assist comprehension."
