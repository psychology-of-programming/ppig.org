title: "A Competence Model for Object-Interaction in Introductory Programming"
authors: [Jens Bennedsen, Carsten Schulte]
abstract: "Assuming that understanding object-oriented programming requires
the understanding of object-interaction, this article outlines the development of
a theoretical model that provides a framework to assess a hierarchy of
competences related to object-interaction. A newly developed test allows for an
in-depth analysis of this hierarchy, including its relationship with other (e.g.
more ‘traditional’) factors that impact students’ understanding of objectoriented
programming. Based on a study at two learning institutions, we
conclude that the proposed model is an effective tool for describing different
competence levels. The analysis of how different factors influence students’
object-interaction skills shows a correlation between object-interaction and
imperative programming, as well as self-efficacy; the correlation between
object-interaction and math, however, was weak. We found that the degree of
visibility of object-interaction in the program text is the most critical factor for
understanding object-interaction. The analysis is followed by a discussion of the
implications of the findings for teaching."
