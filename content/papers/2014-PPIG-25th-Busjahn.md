title: "Developing Coding Schemes for Program Comprehension using Eye Movements"
authors: [Teresa Busjahn, Carsten Schulte, Edna Kropp]
abstract: "This paper introduces an approach to use eye movement data in the context of program comprehension
studies. The central aspect is the development of coding schemes, which reflect cognitive processes
behind the observable visual behavior of programmers. For this purpose, we discuss to first use
a quantitative approach to find those episodes in the eye movements that yield the most potential for
analysis. Subsequently, qualitative methods can be used on this subset."
