title: "Wide, long, or nested data? Reconciling the machine and human viewpoints"
authors: [Alan Hall, Michel Wermelinger, Tony Hirst, Santi Phithakkitnukoon]
abstract: "Data expressed in tables may be re-arranged in various forms, while conveying the same information. This can create a tension when one form is easier to comprehend by a human reader, but another form is more convenient for processing by machine. This problem has received considerable attention for data scientists writing code, but rather less for end user analysts using spreadsheets. We propose a new data model, the “lish”, which supports a spreadsheet-like flexibility of layout, while capturing sufficient structure to facilitate processing. Using a typical example in a prototype editor, we demonstrate how it might help users resolve the tension between the two forms. A user study is in preparation."
