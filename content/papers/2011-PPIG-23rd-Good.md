title: "Self-Reporting Emotional Experiences in Computing Lab Sessions: An Emotional Regulation Perspective"
authors: [Judith Good, Jon Rimmer, Eric Harris, Madeline Balaam]
abstract: "This paper reports on a study in which we compared two technologies for the self-reporting of
emotional experience when learning to program: EmoSense and the Subtle Stones. Students used
each technology concurrently during their computing lab sessions to report on the emotions that they
experienced while programming, such as frustration, enjoyment, pride, etc. We found that the Subtle
Stone, a tangible, hand-held device, was preferred by students, and offered a number of advantages
over EmoSense, a desktop based widget. Most notably, it allowed students to become more aware of
the emotions they were experiencing, and to change their behaviours and problem solving strategies
as a result of this increased awareness. Because of its visibility, the Subtle Stone also allowed
students to become more aware of each othersâ€™ emotional states, and to respond in helpful ways. We
argue that the preference for the Subtle Stone can usefully be considered through the lens of
emotional regulation, and the opportunities that the Subtle Stone provides for both self and mutual
regulation."
