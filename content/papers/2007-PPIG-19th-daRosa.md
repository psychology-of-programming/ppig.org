authors: [Sylvia da Rosa]
abstract: "The ideas presented in this paper concern computer science
education research within Jean Piagetâ€™s theory genetic epistemology. Results
from Piaget and collaborators investigations about the recursive
reasoning on the series of natural numbers are extended to learn about
entering students recursive reasoning on other inductively defined structures.
In this paper the main aspects of that extension are described
using a selected example."
