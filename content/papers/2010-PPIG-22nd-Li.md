title: "Characterizing Comprehension of Concurrency Concepts"
authors: [Zhen Li, Zhe Zhao, Eileen Kraemer]
abstract: "A comprehensive understanding of students' common difficulties in understanding synchronization
and concurrency is a prerequisite for developing tools and educational materials to alleviate these
difficulties. In this paper we briefly present a study through which we identified studentsâ€™
misconceptions about concurrency and synchronization, categorized their misunderstandings into a
misconception pyramid, and built subject profiles through which we were able to discover the nature
and frequency of the misconceptions exhibited by the students in this study. Based on these findings,
we developed metrics to capture the breadth and severity of individual subject's misconceptions. We
describe these metrics and show how they correlate with other measurements of understanding of
concurrency and synchronization."
