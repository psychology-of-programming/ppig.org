title: "Analysing and Interpreting Quantitative Eye-Tracking Data in Studies of Programming: Phases of Debugging with Multiple Representations"
authors: [Roman Bednarik, Markku Tukiainen]
abstract: "While eye-tracking systems become gradually improved and
easier to apply, the methodological challenges of how to analyze, interpret
and relate the eye-tracking data to user processing remain. Studies
of programming behavior are not an exception. We have conducted a
reanalysis of eye-tracking data from a previous study that involved programmers
of two experience groups debugging a program with the help of
graphical representation. Proportional fixation time on each representation,
frequency of visual attention switches between the representations
and type of switch were investigated in relation to five consequential
phases of ten minutes of debugging. Therefore, we have increased the
granularity of focus on debugging process.
<br>
We found some repetitive patterns of visual strategies that were associated
with less experienced programmers finding fewer errors. We also
discovered that at the beginning of the process programmers make use of
both the code- and graphical representations while frequently switching
between them. During the process, more experienced programmers began
to integrate also the output of the program and finish the debugging
with frequent switching between the three representations. We discuss
benefits and limitations of this approach to analyzing and interpreting
the quantitative eye-tracking data. As part of future research we propose
to investigate the symmetries of representation switching behavior."
