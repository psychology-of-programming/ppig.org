title: "An Exploration of Shared Visual Attention in Collaborative Programming"
authors: [Sami Pietinen, Roman Bednarik, Markku Tukiainen]
abstract: "This work-in-progress paper reports on the initial results of an eye-tracking research of collaborative
program development, more particularly, in the case of pair programming. The study was conducted
in nearly industrial-like settings and focused on pair programming productivity and improvement of
the protocol that is followed by the pair-programming pair. Results are based on both the practical
experience during the study and on an analysis of the recorded eye-movements. We present a
descriptive analysis of visual attention during pair programming. We speculate that the pairprogramming
protocol is partly visible in both participantsâ€™ eye-movements and can be used as an
additional source of evidence when investigating the true protocol that the pair actually follows. We
discuss the collaborative view on Psychology of Programming (PoP), which extends it to Psychology
of Software Engineering (PoSE) and we then outline the future directions of our research."
