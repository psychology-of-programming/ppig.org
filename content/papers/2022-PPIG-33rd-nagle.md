title: "On writing workshops for programming"
authors: [Michael Nagle]
abstract: "Over the past year, inspired by personal loss from COVID-19, I took a series of writing workshops in
creative nonfiction, spanning nine months of time. In this paper, I am going to use those writing
workshops as a jumping off point for a workshop of similar format focused on creative programming.
The goal of this paper is to take insight from the form of writing workshops and use them in running a
“writers workshop for programmers.”"
