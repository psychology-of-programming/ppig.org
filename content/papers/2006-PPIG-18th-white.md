title: "The Development Designer Perspective"
authors: [Brent White, Lynn Rampoldi-Hnilo]
abstract: "When creating a decision support tool to assist the selection of a
software interface design it is crucial for the user experience team to understand
how members of development make design decisions. How do developers think
about design and what terminologies do they apply to the design process?
Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted with developers and product
managers responsible for interface design decisions. Results indicated that
members of development focused mainly on making new features consistent
with their current applications and not innovating new interfaces.
Development’s design decision making process relied heavily on input from
peers and senior staff. Development’s terminology for categories that are
factors in design (e.g., user type, user task, layout structure and data structure)
differed from the version conceived by user experience. The synthesis of the
two terminologies has created a basis for building a development decision
support tool."
