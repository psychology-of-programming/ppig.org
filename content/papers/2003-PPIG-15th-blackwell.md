title: "Cognitive Dimensions of Tangible Programming Languages"
authors: [Alan Blackwell]
abstract: "We have in the past described several approaches to programming with tangible interfaces – both specific programming languages implemented in physical form, and physical interfaces (for example to domestic appliances) that have some programmable capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the more generic properties of tangible interfaces as a basis for programmable functionality. The specific target here is finding an application for a new technological approach to tangible interfaces in our lab – the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags. These also bring new constraints to the ways in which tangible user interfaces can be constructed."
