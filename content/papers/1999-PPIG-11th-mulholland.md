title: "Programming with a Purpose: Hank, Gardening and Schema Theory"
authors: [Paul Mulholland, Stuart Watt]
abstract: "Hank is a visual cognitive modelling language designed specifically for psychology students. The aim in designing Hank was to create an experience of cognitive modelling that focused on gaining a new perspective on psychological models rather than programming for its own sake. Recent informal analyses have investigated the effectiveness of Hank in its intended context of use, both as a paper and pencil exercise for individuals, and as a computer based project to be carried out in groups. The findings largely supported the Hank design decisions, and illuminated many of the challenges inherent in designing a programming language for an educational purpose."
