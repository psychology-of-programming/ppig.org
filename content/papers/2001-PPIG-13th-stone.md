title: "The Science of Web-Programming"
authors: [Roger Stone]
abstract: "Although the advent of the World-Wide Web solved the problem of sharing static information between heterogeneous computers and networks, more recently the expectation is that web-sites will offer dynamic information. This increasing dynamic behaviour of web-sites relies on programming. As this is the newest application area for programming it might have been hoped that it would demonstrate the state of the art in programming languages and program design. The truth is that the web has been built on a lowest common denominator approach. This approach together with the reliance on FAQs and web-page tutorials has pervaded programming for the web. However a closer inspection of the process of building a typical dynamic web page reveals an opportunity to exploit some higher level ideas which offer the promise of simpler initial construction and easier maintenance of web-programs."
