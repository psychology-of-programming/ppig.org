title: "A Categorization of Novice Programmers: A Cluster Analysis Study"
authors: [Essi Lahtinen]
abstract: "Beginning software engineering students often lack skills nec-
essary to perform efficient programming work, such as comprehending or
debugging program code. To facilitate the needs of students having dif-
ferent skill levels, teachers should be able to recognize the specific student
groups.

Bloom’s Taxonomy defines educational objectives for the development of
students’ cognitive skills. This paper presents a study of 254 undergrad-
uate students of a basic programming course whose performance were
measured on different levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy. The results of statis-
tical cluster analysis suggest that the obtained student groups did not
align with the Bloom’s Taxonomy: students performing poorly on lower
levels can still perform well on higher taxonomy levels. Based on the re-
sults, this paper suggests six student groups the teacher should recognize
when organizing basic programming courses."
