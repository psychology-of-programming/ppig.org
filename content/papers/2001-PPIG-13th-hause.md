title: "Team Performance Factors in Distributed Collaborative Software Development"
authors: [Martha L. Hause, Mark R. Woodroffe]
abstract: "This paper investigates the interactions of high and low performing distributed student teams using a set of categories to examine their written communication. The teams were involved in a software development project involving two universities located in different countries. This study tracks the progression and changes in the categories coded for each team’s communication throughout the project’s time line to determine characteristics of high and low performing teams."
