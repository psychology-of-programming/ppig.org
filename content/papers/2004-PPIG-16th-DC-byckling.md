title: "Roles of Variables and Strategic Programming Knowledge"
authors: [Pauli Byckling]
abstract: "Roles of variables [6] are a new concept that can be utilized, e.g., in teaching programming to
novices. Roles represent programming knowledge on a higher level than simple programming
language knowledge. Role knowledge has traditionally been tacit but it can be made explicit and thus
help students to understand the ways variables are used in programs. Roles are easy to adopt in
teaching, too: in one study, computer science teachers learned in less than an hour to recognize roles
in their typical uses with 90 % accuracy.
<br>
The main issue of my research work and the subject of my doctoral thesis will be to describe the
effects of the role concept in the emergence of strategic programming knowledge, i.e., to find answers
in questions like \"how does the role concept effect in the progression of programming methods and
comprehension strategies in programming at the novice level\". Another research question is to study
the effects of the role concept in strategic programming knowledge among expert programmers."
