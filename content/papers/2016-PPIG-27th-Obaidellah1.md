title: "Comprehension and Composition of Flowcharts"
authors: [Unaizah Obaidellah]
abstract: "The common problem of the students’ failure in programming courses is due to the lack of problem solving skills. This is regarded as the lack of ability to understand the problems, divide them in sub-portions, and integrate them as a complete solution. The main purpose of this paper is to present preliminary findings of students’ comprehension and composition abilities focusing on problem solving activities related to interpreting code into flowcharts and flowcharts into code. The group of students tested were undertaking their second programming course. Initial findings from this study showed that the students possessed relatively weak problem solving skills even if they scored well in their fundamental programming course."
