title: "Intuition in Software Development Revisited"
authors: [Meurig Beynon, Russell Boyatt, Zhan En Chan]
abstract: "The role of intuition in software development was discussed in a most original fashion
by Peter Naur in 1984. Yet there has been little subsequent interest in elaborating on Naur’s ideas.
In seeking to explain this neglect, we argue that the accepted views of software development, both
within the formal and pragmatic traditions, are deeply influenced by a conceptual framework inherited
from computer science and that, within this framework, making sense of the relation between
intuition and software development is inherently difficult. In much more recent publications, Naur
himself has related his thinking about software development to the philosophical outlook of William
James. We discuss the current status and potential implications of Naur’s original reflections on
the role of intuition with reference to trends in thinking about software development since 1984,
and to an alternative conceptual framework for computing, afforded by Empirical Modelling, that
can be directly related to a Jamesian philosophical stance."
