title: "Salvation for Bricoleurs"
authors: [Tzippora Yeshno, Mordechai Ben-Ari]
abstract: "Users demonstrate bricolage (aimless trial and error) in their interaction with applications like word processors. This can be attributed to behaviorist and minimalist task-oriented learning. We show that explicitly teaching a conceptual model can improve both the task performance and the understanding of the learners."
