title: "Using cognitive dimensions to compare prototyping"
authors: [Andy Dearden, Jawed Siddiqi, Amir Naghsh]
abstract: "In this paper, we explore the characteristics of different prototyping techniques applied in interactive systems design. Our analysis applies the ‘cognitive dimensions’ framework, and is informed by an appreciation of four key activities within the design and development of software, namely: the authoring of design proposals; the validation of those proposals with users; implementations mediated by prototypes and specific ations; and confirmation of developed systems. In previous discussions of prototyping, attention has focussed upon a concept of ‘fidelity’ of the prototype, discussing the relative merits of lo-fidelity and hi-fidelity prototypes. Our assessment offers a more fine-grained analysis of methods, helps to clarify important distinctions between prototyping methods, and may be used to inform the selection or development of prototyping tools and techniques."
