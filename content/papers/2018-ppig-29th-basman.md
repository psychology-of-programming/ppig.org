title: "What Lies in the Path of the Revolution"
authors: [Antranig Basman]
abstract: "Increasingly, the rights and capabilities to own technological artefacts, where they exist at all, are reserved to corporations and not to citizens. There are historical, economic, metaphysical, ideological and cognitive reasons for this situation, in addition to purely technological factors, which we will trace by following the fate of various concrete examples, analysed into five categories of ownable elements. These categories are those of ownable function, ownable expression, ownable data, ownable installations and ownable economies. In this paper, we attempt to align these goals of ownability into a research and activism program by describing a set of revolutionary goals in each category, and tracing ways we could reach them."
