title: "Empirically Refining a Model of Programmers’ Information-Seeking Behavior during Software Maintenance"
authors: [Jim Buckley, Michael P. O’Brien, Norah Power]
abstract: "Several authors have proposed information seeking as an appropriate
perspective for studying software maintenance activities. However, there is little
research in the literature describing holistic information-seeking models in this
context. Additionally, in the one instance where an information-seeking model
has been proposed, the empirical evidence presented in support of that model is
extremely limited. This paper presents a small quasi-experiment that serves to
further evaluate and refine this preliminary information-seeking model. Talkaloud
data, generated by two professional programmers, engaged in real software
maintenance activities, was captured and then coded. This evaluation
largely validated the model but also suggested several important refinements.
The study, its results and its impact on the information-seeking model are discussed
in this paper."
