title: "Perceived Self-Efficacy and APIs"
authors: [John M. Daughtry III, John M. Carroll]
abstract: "Application program interface (API) use and design is critical, non-optional, and cross-cutting in the
construction of modern software systems. However, only recently has the explicit study of API design
process and API designs been initiated from the perspective of usability, and little is known with
respect to how various forms of information about an API aids programmers in the use of an API. In
this paper, we present findings from our exploration of perceived self-efficacy (PSE) for API use.
First, we describe the development of a novel PSE instrument that focuses on the task of using an
API. Second, we evaluate the validity and sensitivity of the instrument with respect to changes in the
information given professional programmers about an API. To accomplish this goal, we articulate and
utilize two complementary forms of API documentation grounded in scenario-based design. Through
this work, we demonstrate the validity of the evaluation tool and raise questions about the perceived
value developers place on information about an API and its intended use."
