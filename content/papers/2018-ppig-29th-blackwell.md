title: "A Craft Practice of Programming Language Research"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "It has become increasingly common to consider programming as a craft practice, driven largely by tools that are sufficiently responsive for reflective conversation with material, agile design processes, and live coded performance. This paper considers some of the epistemological questions that arise in programming as a critical technical practice, and especially when programming language research itself is taken seriously to be a craft."
