title: "Programming \"systems\" deserve a theory too!"
authors: [Joel Jakubovic]
abstract: "It is comparatively easy to find new languages and derivative work within academic publishing, but somewhat harder for more general programming \"systems\" or \"environments\" which encompass more than that. This is a shame, since some of these have a dedicated following and have influenced programming and computing at large. We concentrate on some examples of such that, for various reasons, do not have much material written about them. We suggest some reasons to expect this, and draw attention to some characteristics (both \"cognitive\" and \"technical\") marking them worthy of further study. We conclude with a sketch of further steps to make the most of these software artefacts from a research perspective."
