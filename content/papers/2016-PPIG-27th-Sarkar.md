title: "Towards spreadsheet tools for end-user music programming"
authors: [Advait Sarkar]
abstract: "SheetMusic, an early-stage prototype, explores how spreadsheets can be used as accessible end-user
tools for music programming and data sonification. This design probe uncovers many interesting questions:
what are the primary advantages of the spreadsheet paradigm in this context? Should such a tool
be regarded as a musical instrument, or as a way to create musical ‘programs’ with emergent runtime
behaviour? How can musical experiences be ‘programmatic’? How sophisticated should provisions
for scripting the tool be? How can time be represented? Each issue is considered in turn, drawing on
previous work in live music coding, end-user programming, and the current SheetMusic implementation."
