title: "Schema Detection and Beacon-Based Classiffcation for Algorithm Recognition"
authors: [Ahmad Taherkhani]
abstract: "We introduce a method for recognizing algorithms based on programming schemas,
which are generic conceptual knowledge with details abstracted out, and beacons, which are key
statements that suggest existence of speciffc structures in code. First, the method detects the
schemas related to the implementation of the target algorithm and next it computes the characteristics
and algorithm-speciffc beacons from the detected code and uses them as the learning data
to construct a classiffcation tree for recognizing new unseen instances.
<br>
We demonstrate the method and its performance for searching, heap, basic tree traversal and
graph algorithms implemented in Java (N = 222). The results show that 94.1% of the schemas
are detected correctly and the estimated accuracy of the classiffcation measured by leave-one-out
cross-validation technique is 97.3%."
