title: "The Importance of Cognitive and Usability Elements in Designing Software Visualization Tools"
authors: [Glauco de F. Carneiro, Manoel Mendon√ßa]
abstract: "Modern IDEs offer built-in support for developing plug-ins. More recently, we have seen a growing
number of plug-ins that offer non-conventional software visualization interfaces. They usually aim to
help programmers to understand unfamiliar source code by representing it in visual structures such as
trees, scatter-plots or graphs. Although very attractive visually, we need to know more about the
effectiveness of these interfaces in conveying information to software engineers. In this paper, we
discuss some concepts and guidelines regarding the requirements of visualization tools for software
comprehension as well as the set-up of an infrastructure to empirically evaluate how useful are those
tools in supporting software comprehension activities."
