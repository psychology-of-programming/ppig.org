title: "A Roles-Based Approach to Variable-Oriented Programming"
authors: [Juha Sorva]
abstract: "Delocalized variable plans pose problems for novice programmers
trying to read and write programs. Variable-oriented programming
is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the importance of variablerelated
schemas and brings actions pertaining to each variable together
in one place in program code. This paper revisits the idea of variableoriented
programming and shows how it can be founded on roles of variables,
stereotypes of variable use suitable for teaching to novices. The paper
sketches out how variable-oriented, roles-based programming could
be implemented using either a new programming language or a framework
built on an existing language. The possible applications, merits
and problems of a roles-based approach and variable-oriented programming
in general are discussed. This paper points at possible research
directions for the future and provides a basis for further discussions of
variable-oriented, roles-based programming."
