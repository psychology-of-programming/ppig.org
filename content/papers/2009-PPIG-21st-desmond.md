title: "An evaluation of the inline source code exploration technique"
authors: [Michael Desmond, Chris Exton]
abstract: "The exploration of source code in modern integrated development environments can lead to
disorientation problems due to a lack of visible exploration context as the programmer moves between
successive source code displays.
<br>
Inline source code exploration is a technology which facilitates the exploration of source code in
context. In contrast to explicitly navigating between isolated displays of source code, the programmer
fluidly introduces related source code declarations into the context of a primary or focal source code
document. The inline approach provides an explicit representation of exploration context between
successive source code locations, provides support for the pursuit of exploratory digressions, and
allows the programmer to view multiple related source code locations simultaneously with minimal
interface adjustment.
<br>
In this paper we introduce inline source code exploration and describe a user experiment designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of the technique at reducing the level of disorientation experienced by
programmers during source code exploration activities."
