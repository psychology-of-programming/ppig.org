title: "Falling Behind Early and Staying Behind When Learning to Program"
authors: [Alireza Ahadi, Raymond Lister, Donna Teague]
abstract: "We have performed a study of novice programmers, using students at two different institutions, who
were learning different programming languages. Influenced by the work of Dehnadi and Bornat, we
gave our students a simple test, of our own devising, in their first three weeks of formal instruction in
programming. That test only required knowledge of assignment statements. We found a wide
performance difference among our two student cohorts. Furthermore, our test was a good indication
of how students performed about 10 weeks later, in their final programming exam. We interpret our
results in terms of our neo-Piagetian theory of how novices learn to program."
