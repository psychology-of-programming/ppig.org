title: "Undergraduate students’ learning approaches and learning to program"
authors: [Melanie Coles, Keith Phalp]
abstract: "This study uses the Revised Two Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) to explore undergraduate students’ approaches learning to program. The expectation being that students using deep learning approaches will gain higher programming grades than students who use surface approaches. There is strong evidence to support the hypothesis that deep approaches are related to higher grade outcomes, and surface approaches to lower. There is also strong evidence to support the hypothesis that students who ‘hate’ programming do less well than those that do not. There is however, no evidence that previous programming experience has an impact upon the student programming grade."
