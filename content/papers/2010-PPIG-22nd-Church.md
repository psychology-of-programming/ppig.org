title: "Liveness in Notation Use: From Music to Programming"
authors: [Luke Church, Chris Nash, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "In this paper we draw an analogy between musical systems and programming environments,
concentrating on user experience associated with feedback and its implications for flow. We present a
number of different analytical frames all of which, we suggest, influence the nature of this feedback
and with it, the user experience. We introduce a new diagrammatic analysis format, and use it to
explore the kinds of feedback loop present in musical systems, what such systems might teach us in
the analytical description of programming languages, and vice versa."
