title: "Usability requirements for interaction-oriented development tools"
authors: [Catherine Letondal, Stéphane Chatty, W. Greg Phillips, Fabien André, and

abstract: "Building interactive software is a notoriously complex task, for which many programming
tools have been proposed over the years. Although the research community has sporadically
identified usability requirements for such tools, tool proponents rarely document their design processes
and there is no established reference for comparing tools with requirements. Furthermore,
the design of most tools is strongly influenced by the design of their underlying general purpose
programming languages. These in turn were designed from their own set of little-documented requirements,
which adds to the confusion. In this paper, we provide a review and classification of the
requirements and properties expected of interactive development tools. We review how designers of
APIs and toolkits for interaction-oriented systems set the usability requirements for the programming
interface of their systems. We relate our analysis to other studies in related domains such as
end-user programming, natural programming, and teaching."
