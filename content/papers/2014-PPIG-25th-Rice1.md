title: "Linking Linguistics and Programming: How to start? (Work in Progress)"
authors: [J. E. Rice, I. Genee, and F. Naz]
abstract: "Sociolinguistics is described as \"the study of how language and social factors such as
ethnicity, social class, age, gender, and educational level are related\". Social factors may result in
differences in language use, which may then be referred to as sociolinguistic differences. The goal of
this project is to answer the following question: is it possible to identify sociolinguistic differences
in the way people use programming languages? How might we go about answering our question?
We propose that techniques from corpus linguistics may be of use. Computer-based techniques such
as text mining allow the use of software in the identification of trends in language use that would
otherwise require an enormous amount of human effort to discover. Once various sociolinguistic
differences have been identified by computational means, traditional critical analysis methods can
then be applied for further analysis."
