title: "Empirically-Observed End-User Programming Behaviors in Yahoo! Pipes"
authors: [Matthew D. Dinmore, C. Curtis Boylls]
abstract: "Yahoo! Pipes is a well-known, widely used visual programming environment for creating data
mashups by aggregating, manipulating, and publishing web feeds. It provides a natural laboratory for
observing a range of end-user programming (EUP) behaviors on a large scale. We have examined
more than 30,000 Pipes compositions in a search for regularities that might inform the design of EUP
systems and their services. Although Pipes primitives span a broad range of functionality and can be
richly parameterized and composed, we find a number of patterns that govern the structure and
parameterization of Pipes in the wild. Most users sample only a tiny fraction of the available design
space, and simple models describe their composition behaviors. Our findings are consistent with the
idea that users attempt to minimize the degrees of freedom associated with a composition as it is built
and used."
