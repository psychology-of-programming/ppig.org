title: "Do mathematical proof skills in continuous areas of Maths develop algorithmic thinking in CS students in HE?"
authors: [Julia Crossley]
abstract: "The aim of this proposal is to suggest a possible mechanism for developing abstract skills in
Computer Science students during their undergraduate studies. Some research has gone into the
development of conceptual skills in school aged students and into the meaning of abstraction. My aim
is to develop methods using the idea of Mathematical proofs, to help students generalise, which will
help them develop self-efficacy and confidence in using their intellectual curiosity. Students will be
exposed to formal proofs, and most of all encouraged to think of some themselves."
