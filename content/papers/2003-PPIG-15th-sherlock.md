title: "Using laddering and on-line self-report to elicit design rationale for software"
authors: [Gary Sherlock, Gordon Rugg]
abstract: "This paper discusses issues relating to elicitation of design rationale for software, and describes how we used two techniques in combination to elicit information about design rationale for software (in this case, Web pages). We found that students and professional designers did have more knowledge, and more richly structured knowledge, than members of the public; however, this knowledge made little explicit reference to design guidelines from the academic literature. Using two techniques in combination allowed us to identify and clarify issues which would probably have been missed by using each technique independently, and we recommend that more systematic use should be made of combinations of techniques for work in this area."
