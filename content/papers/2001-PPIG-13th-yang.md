title: "Human and “human-like” type explanations"
authors: [Yang Jun, Greg Michaelson, Phil Trinder]
abstract: "The behaviour of a “human-like” polymorphic type explanation system is analysed using the same categories as those used to characterise human expert type explanation behaviour. The results suggest that the computer system has a similar behaviour profile to that of a composite human expert."
