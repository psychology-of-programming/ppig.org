abstract: "The success of a software development project is associated not only with tools and
technologies, but it also depends on how much the development process helps to be user-centered
and developer-oriented. Involving customers in the process and being people-oriented, Extreme
Programming (XP)– One of the popular agile methods – can be a choice for developing a usable
system. The project under study is a multimedia streaming application for mobile phones that
allows to make content-based search for audio and video content in large databases and play it on
a mobile phone virtually anywhere, at any time. Our approach to application development focuses
on the adoption of XP and User-Centered Design (UCD), emphasizing iterative user-interface
development involving usability engineers and end-users.
<br>
The paper describes the process of integrating XP with user-centered design and shows how an
agile development technique facilitates to be user-oriented and at the same time preserves the social
values of the development team."
