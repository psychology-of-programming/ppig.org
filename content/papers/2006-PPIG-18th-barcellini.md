title: "Users’ participation to the design process in an Open Source Software online community"
authors: [Flore Barcellini, Françoise Détienne, Jean-Marie Burkhardt]
abstract: "The objective of this research is to analyse the ways members of
open-source software communities participate in design. In particular we
focus on how users of an Open Source (OS) programming language (Python)
participate in adding new functionalities to the language. Indeed, in the OS
communities, users are highly skilled in computer sciences; they do not
correspond to the common representation of end-users and can potentially
participate to the design process. Our study characterizes the Python galaxy
and analyses a formal process to introduce new functionalities to the language
called Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) from the idea of language
evolution to the PEP implementation. The analysis of a particular pushed-byusers
PEP from one application domain community (financial), shows: that
the design process is distributed and specialized between online and physical
interactions spaces; and there are some cross participants between users and
developers communities which may reveal boundary spanners roles."
