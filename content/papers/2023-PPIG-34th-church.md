title: "A brief history of the human centric study of programming languages"
authors: [Luke Church, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "The study of programming languages focussing on the needs of the programmer has been a subject of
intellectual enquiry for at least the past 50 years. We draw one through this history that is likely to be
of particular interest to the Psychology of Programming audience highlighting recurring tensions of
internal validity, generalisability and practical utility. We suggest this longer term perspective is useful
for informing contemporary debates."
