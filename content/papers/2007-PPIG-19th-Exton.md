title: "An experiential report on the limitations of experimentation as a means of empirically investigating software practitioners"
authors: [Chris Exton, Gabriela Avram, Jim Buckley, Andrew LeGear]
abstract: "This paper outlines the needs for careful empirical-design choices
during the study of software practitioners. It does this by presenting a documented,
but unpublished, in-vivo, empirical, group study. The study was initially
conceived as an experiment but was subsequently overwhelmed by human
and other factors. As a consequence, only more observational comments could
be derived from the study. In this paper, the study is analyzed and discussed, as
a means of illustrating the conflict that often exists between in-vivo empirical
studies and the experimental paradigm."
