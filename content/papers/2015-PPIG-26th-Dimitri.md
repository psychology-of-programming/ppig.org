title: "The impact of Syntax Highlighting in Sonic Pi"
authors: [Giovanna Maria Dimitri]
abstract: "We present an empirical study investigating the role of syntax highlighting in Sonic
Pi, considering both program writing and program debugging tasks. Data were collected from 10
participants, who were asked to execute writing and debugging tasks, while their screens were
recorded. We observed how syntax highlighting significantly improves task completion time in the
case of writing as well as of debugging tasks. In particular we investigated debugging of a common
mistake in the Sonic Pi environment, which we called colon-space feature because of the underlying
Ruby syntax. Moreover we observed a correlation between syntax mistakes with programming
experience and musical experience. If the task is highlighted the task completion time decreases
with the increasing of programming experience, while this decreasing trend is not so significant in
the case of an increasing musical experience."
