title: "A Loop is a Compression"
authors: [Walter Milner]
abstract: "An outcome from a larger research project is described. This places work seeking to
understand how novices learn elementary programming notions in a wider framework derived from
cognitive science, and in particular the group of ideas centered on conceptual blends. The
framework is outlined and the research methodology is described, followed by some of the data
gathered. It is suggested that students' consideration of code fragments can be analysed in terms of
mental spaces, and that loop statements represent compressions. The implications for teaching are
discussed, and future work is outlined."
