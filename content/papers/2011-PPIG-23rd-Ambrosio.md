title: "Study Attitudes and Behaviour of CS1 Students – Two Realities"
authors: [Ana Paula Ambrosio, Scheila W. Martins]
abstract: "Teaching basic programming in higher education is one of the great challenges of computing. Much
effort has been dedicated to the research of new languages, tools and methodologies that may help
reduce the failure rates. Furthermore, analysis of student’s cognitive abilities and attitudes have been
undertaken to identify relevant characteristics that help understand the variables associated to the
encountered difficulties. This paper presents results obtained through the application of the IACHE
inventory, a generic behaviour test for higher education, to introductory programming students in
Brazil and in Portugal."
