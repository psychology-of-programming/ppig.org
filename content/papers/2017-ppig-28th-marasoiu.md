title: "User experiences in a visual analytics business"
authors: [Mariana Marasoiu, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "We report on an ongoing ethnographic study conducted at a data analytics company and discuss the multiple facets of user experience observed in this context. We describe in detail two interaction episodes of analysts working with visual analytics software and characterize them through the Patterns of User Experience framework. We discuss the implications of our observations and make some recommendations for future tool design."
