title: "Using Mapping Studies in Software Engineering"
authors: [David Budgen, Mark Turner, Pearl Brereton, Barbara Kitchenham]
abstract: "
<b>Background:</b> A mapping study provides a systematic and objective procedure for identifying the nature and
extent of the empirical study data that is available to answer a particular research question. Such studies can
also form a useful preliminary step for PhD study.
<br>
<b>Aim:</b> We set out to assess how effective such studies have been when used for software engineering topics, and
to identify the specific challenges that they present.
<br>
<b>Method:</b> We have conducted an informal review of a number of mapping studies in software engineering,
describing their main characteristics and the forms of analysis employed.
<br>
<b>Results:</b> We examine the experiences and outcomes from six mapping studies, of which four are published.
From these we note a recurring theme about the problems of classification and a preponderance of ‘gaps’ in
the set of empirical studies.
<br>
<b>Conclusions:</b> We identify our challenges as improving classification guidelines, encouraging better reporting
of primary studies, and argue for identifying some ’empirical grand challenges’ for software engineering as a
focus for the community."
