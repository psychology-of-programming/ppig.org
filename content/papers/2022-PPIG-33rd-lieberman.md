title: "The Psychology of Programming and the Psychology of Mathematics"
authors: [Henry Lieberman]
abstract: "Many fundamental results in mathematical logic and set theory, among other mathematical
fields, were developed long before the advent of computers and modern computer science.
Many of these proofs depend crucially on symbol-manipulation procedures, originally
described in the proofs with prose or with equations that specify constraints on the
procedures. We recast some of these procedures with modern computer science concepts, in
modern programming languages, and discover (perhaps not surprisingly), that... some of them
have bugs.
<br>
One reason that these bugs may have gone unnoticed for so long may be due to differences in
how mathematicians and programmers think about procedures. Programmers think about
control structures and temporal relationships, whereas mathematicians want to abstract away
from time. The equation is ubiquitous in mathematical language, whereas programmers have
discovered the \"=\" can have different roles: definition, equality testing, and assignment.
Programmers think computationally, whereas mathematicians are comfortable with \"there
exists\" descriptions, which may prove uncomputable. Finally, the two fields have different
ideas about the notion of abstraction, which affect how their concepts are introduced and how
they are used."
