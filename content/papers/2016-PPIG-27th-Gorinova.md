title: "The End-User Programming Challenge of Data Wrangling"
authors: [Maria Gorinova, Karl Prince, Sallyanne Meakins, Alain Vuylsteke, Matthew Jones, Alan Blackwell]
abstract: "We present a case study of requirements for “data wrangling” capabilities in a healthcare application
context. Data wrangling is an increasingly common requirement for data scientists, policy makers,
market researchers, intelligence analysts, and other professions where existing data must be used in
ways that were not envisioned when it was first collected. We characterise data wrangling as a
programming problem, in which aggregate data must be restructured in ways that remain consistent
with its semantic origins or ontological referents. We recommend the table as a lowest common
denominator representational device, affording both direct manipulation and programming by
example. We describe work in progress, in which we have identified new opportunities for clinical
end-users to interact with the content of a customisable information system, through a focus on tables
as an approachable analytic tool."
