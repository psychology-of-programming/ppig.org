title: "Patterns for HCI and Cognitive Dimensions: two halves of the same story?"
authors: [Sally Fincher]
abstract: "This paper firstly surveys the search for Patterns and Pattern Languages (PL) in HCI, and examines some of the problems that the search has encountered. Secondly, some aspects of the Cognitive Dimensions (CD) framework are examined and I suggest that there may be a relationship between the two endeavours, to the probable enhancement of the pattern endeavour and the possible enhancement of the expression of the CD framework."
