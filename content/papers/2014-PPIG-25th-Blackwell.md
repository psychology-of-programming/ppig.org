title: "Exploring Creative Learning for the Internet of Things era"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell, Samuel Aaron, Rachel Drury]
abstract: "We describe a study of a group of artists commissioned to create a new artwork involving
programming with the Raspberry Pi computer. From an initial sample of 10 professional artists who
mainly work with conventional media, 5 were selected for an intensive series of workshops leading to
public presentations of the project and their work. The artists learned to program using the Sonic Pi
environment that had recently been created for use in schools. During the project, the Sonic Pi
language was also enhanced with new features in response to the artistsâ€™ creative objectives.
Throughout the project, data was collected to record the experiences of the artists, including initial
self-efficacy questionnaires, reflective diaries, workshop evaluations, and focus group discussion."
