title: "Software and How it Lives On - Embedding Live Programs in the World Around Them"
authors: [Antranig Basman, Luke Church, Clemens Klokmose, Colin Clark]
abstract: "Virtues beyond those that traditionally motivate live programming are needed to support lively and
unbounded communities of authors collaborating by creating and using shared artefacts. We will argue
for the importance of each element of an artefactâ€™s design to be externalizable, and introduce terms
describing the function of parts of a fully capable live externalizable system (the res potentia and res
extensa). We critique the standard presentation of live programming, situating it within a wider set of
authorial values. We introduce the quantity of divergence of a programming language or system and
explain the desirability of minimising it. We survey some existing systems through this taxonomy and
speculate how future systems could improve on them."
