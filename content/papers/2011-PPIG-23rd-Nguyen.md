title: "A case study on the usability of NXT-G programming language"
authors: [Khuong A. Nguyen]
abstract: "The release of the Lego Mindstorms kit has carried the exibility and creativity of Lego into the world of robotics, whilst targeting a variety of children and adults audiences. To achieve this goal, a programming language called NXT-G was developed to provide everyone full control of the Lego Mindstorms kit, regardless of their programming experience. In this project, the programming language ambition is tested through practical experiments. In a controlled experiment, twelve participants carry out four tasks using the NXT-G software and a Lego robot. Their performances are then analysed to confirm the stated claim."
