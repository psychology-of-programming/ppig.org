title: "Concrete Thoughts on Abstraction"
authors: [Keiron Nicholson, Judith Good, Katy Howland]
abstract: "This paper considers the notion of abstraction and its relevance to the computational thinking
agenda, including potential difficulties with its use, and possible solutions. We first discuss a paper
by Blackwell, Church and Green (2008), “The Abstract is the Enemy”, in which the authors use four
examples of software design projects to outline the potential dangers of abstraction. The
example projects all show how unhelpful abstractions can cause problems for users, and the
authors argue that these problems result from attempts to mediate the human and
technological worlds. Blackwell et al. (2008) then argue that the computational thinking drive
may invite people to adopt a particular style of thinking and problem‐solving; one which sees
abstraction as ‘a friend’. We argue that abstraction is neither friend nor enemy but simply a tool
which can be helpful, or not, depending on the manner and context of its use. We propose that
whilst the computational thinking agenda does in fact recognise this, it has not yet offered
suggestions as to how people can be taught to use this tool effectively. We consider abstraction
in terms of five key skills: considering the context in which the abstraction operates, defining
and choosing the right abstraction, working with multiple layers of abstraction simultaneously,
considering abstractions critically, and knowing when to use abstraction. Within these five skill
groups, we consider fourteen sub‐skills which we see as important to the successful use and
teaching of abstraction. As such, they allow us to begin to design a ‘curriculum for abstraction’."
