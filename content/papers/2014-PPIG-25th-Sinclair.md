title: "Educational Programming Languages: The Motivation to Learn with Sonic Pi"
authors: [Arabella Jane Sinclair]
abstract: "This work explores the differences in novice users experiences when learning a simplified
variant of the Ruby programming language for the first time. Sonic Pi and Kids Ruby both aim
to teach users via a media-oriented set of programming exercises and environment, on the premise
that this accessible domain will motivate novice learners. Users retention of the language and
interaction style with each environment were measured and the results indicate that Sonic Pi
facilitates a greater level of user experimentation and concept retention."
