title: "The Effect of Using Problem-Solving Tutors on the Self-Confidence of Students"
authors: [Amruth N Kumar]
abstract: "We have been developing software tutors to help students learn programming concepts by solving problems. We evaluated the effect of these tutors on the self-confidence of the students in fall 2004 and spring 2005. We found that the self-confidence of the class as a whole increases. However, there is no correlation between the change in learning and the change in the selfconfidence of the students."
