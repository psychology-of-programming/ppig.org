title: "An Experiment on the Effects of Program Code Highlighting on Visual Search for Local Patterns"
authors: [Tuomas Hakala, Pekka Nykyri, Jorma Sajaniemi]
abstract: "Many current program editors use syntax highlighting but
effects of various coloring schemes are not known. This paper presents
the results of an experiment where three coloring schemes were used
by intermediate programmers in visual search tasks for local patterns
in Java programs. Differences between the coloring schemes were small
and not statistically significant. Especially, in contrast to intuition, the
control scheme, black text on white background, resulted in the same
overall search performance as the other coloring schemes. Differences be-
tween search target types were statistically significant and each coloring
scheme turned out to be best for some target type but the interaction
was statistically only almost significant."
