title: "What makes Software Engineers go that extra mile?"
authors: [Rien Sach, Helen Sharp, Marian Petre]
abstract: "Current research suggests that motivation factors in software engineering are evolving and that our current understanding of motivation in software engineering is out of date. In this paper an analysis of semi-structured interviews with 13 professional software engineers is presented. The data suggests that „the work‟ makes software engineers go that extra mile and that „people‟ are important, but that „obstacles‟ really sap the energy of software engineers."
