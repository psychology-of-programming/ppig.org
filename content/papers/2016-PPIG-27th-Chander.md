title: "A gaze-directed lens for touchless analytics"
authors: [Abhishek Chander, Advait Sarkar]
abstract: "We present the design and implementation of a gaze-directed lens tool for the interactive exploration
of quantitative chart visualisations. In view of visual analytics as end-user programming, we present
lenses which enable the selective display of labels, as well as interaction with parameterised uncertainty.
We describe an algorithm for smoothing the movement of the lens. We report a controlled, withinsubjects
experiment on 11 participants demonstrating that participants were as adept at moving the lens
with their gaze as they were using a mouse, and furthermore, that the gaze-directed interface promoted
greater inspection of the key regions of the graphs."
