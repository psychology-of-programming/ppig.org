title: "For Modeling Programmers as Readers with Cognitive Literary Science"
authors: [Rijul Jain]
abstract: "The prevalent text-based form of human-generative AI interactions has blurred the lines between code
and prose. I argue that understanding the cognitive effects of these interactions by modeling users not
only as programmers, but as readers, will inform the design of better tools to bolster human agency in
generative AI interactions. I hope to begin a conversation around the uses of cognitive literary science
for the study of the psychology of programming."
