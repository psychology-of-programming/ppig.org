title: "Understanding code quality for introductory courses"
authors: [Martijn Stegeman]
abstract: "An exploration of the meaning of `code quality' for introductory programming courses
has led to a model that brings together teacher feedback and suggestions from professional handbooks.
We translated this model into a rubric for giving feedback to students in their first courses. Using
this rubric in teaching has encouraged us to reflect on the intent of programming language features
and how these can be used appropriately. We now propose future work: how can `approriate use' be
more systematically integrated into the model? Furthermore, we propose that using the derived
rubric in teaching may very well confront students with unnoticed misconceptions and help them
eliminate these. Is this a reasonable assumption? How can we test it?"
