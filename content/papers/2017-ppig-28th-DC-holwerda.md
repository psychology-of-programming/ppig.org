title: "Block-based languages for professionals"
authors: [Robert Holwerda]
abstract: "Block-based languages should no longer be regarded solely as a stepping stone to text-based languages. In fact, the design of block-based languages should evolve towards a programming-UI that (adult) professionals find productive and pleasant to use, even on a day-to-day basis. Current block-based languages are not there yet.
<br>
We intend to research the design-space for block-based language interfaces with these new users and usages in mind, focussing on web designers. An initial user-study, exposing design students to a block-based version of a programming language they already know, kicks off this research."
