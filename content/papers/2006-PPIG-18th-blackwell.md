title: "Metaphors we Program By: Space, Action and Society in Java"
authors: [Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "A corpus analysis of the standard Java documentation revealed the
range of conceptual metaphors shared by library authors and users of packages
such as java.util and java.bean. These metaphors included the expected mental
models of internal program behaviour, but also consistent references to a spatial
image-world with material properties and flows. More surprisingly, program
components are metaphorically understood as actors with beliefs and intentions,
working together according to social relationships. Rather than mechanical
imperative models or mathematical declarative ones, it seems that one of the
most widespread bases for conceptual models of programming is of social
entities that act as proxies for their developers. This may have significant
implications for the design of new programming languages and environments."
