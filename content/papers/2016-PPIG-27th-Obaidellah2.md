title: "Assessing Novices’ Program Comprehension based on Linked List Diagrams"
authors: [Unaizah Obaidellah]
abstract: "Learning data structure can be difficult for low performing or novice students. Using diagrams during problem solving may benefit their program and algorithm understanding. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of linked list diagrams in assisting these students to solve specified problems in terms of naming operations and writing code for selected list operations of the data structure. Twenty eight novice computer science undergraduate students took part in this assessment. The metric used was students’ accuracy to name the list operations and to write their corresponding code. Findings revealed that the problem solving process was best supported in the presence of some amount of diagrammatic notation that describes the operation under consideration."
