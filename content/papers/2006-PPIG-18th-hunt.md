title: "Stories from the Mobile Workplace: An Emerging Narrative Ethnography"
authors: [J. Hunt, P. Romero, J. Good]
abstract: "This paper presents preliminary results from a narrativeethnographic
field study of a small mobile software development company.
Initial ethnographic findings are presented, and further narrative
analysis is proposed in the areas of stories relating to programmer stereotyping,
war stories, and humour. It is expected that the study will form
the first case-study for a broader comparative investigation into how stories
are used and told across software development methodologies."
