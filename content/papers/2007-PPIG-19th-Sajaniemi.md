title: "From Procedures to Objects: What Have We (Not) Done?"
authors: [Jorma Sajaniemi, Marja Kuittinen]
abstract: "Programming education has experienced a shift from imperative and
procedural programming to object-orientation. This shift has been motivated by
educators’ desire to please information technology industry and potential students;
it is not motivated by psychology of programming nor by computer science
education research—there are practically no results that would indicate that
such a shift is desirable, needed in the first place, or even effective for learning
programming. Moreover, there has been an implicit assumption that classic results
on imperative and procedural programming education and learning apply to
OO programming, also, but we argue that this is not the case and, therefore, call
for systematic research into the fundamental cognitive and educational issues in
learning and teaching OO programming.
<br>
In order to understand the huge shift from imperative and procedural programming
to object-orientation, we compare these paradigms at three levels: notations
of languages, the notional machine that describes how programs are executed,
and the orientation of a paradigm describing what programs are for and what can
be done with them. We will also review research literature and see how it supports
our claims. Finally, we present a research agenda intended to improve the
understanding of OO programming and OO programming education."
