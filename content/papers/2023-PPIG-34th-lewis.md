title: "Large Language Models and the Psychology of Programming"
authors: [Clayton Lewis]
abstract: "Large Language Models have emerged rapidly as powerful coding tools, in some cases showing the
ability to create entire working programs, and (more commonly) providing help with the details of a great
many APIs and frameworks. This emergence raises a number of questions for the PPIG community. Will
these tools change what programmers do, in ways that affect \"the psychology of programming\"? Given
the (apparent) command that these systems have of natural language, and of the semantics of a great
many domains of activity, can they be used to enhance the kinds of interactions with software tools that
PPIG researchers have studied? Noting that large language models exhibit analogical reasoning as an
emergent capability, can they leverage insights from early research on programming by analogy? Does
predictive modelling, as a key cognitive process that can be applied in many domains, suggest new ways
to think about programming not based on text?"
