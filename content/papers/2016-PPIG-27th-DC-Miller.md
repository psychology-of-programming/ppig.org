title: "Programmer Experience Design and the Spreadsheet Paradigm"
authors: [Gary Miller]
abstract: "This doctoral consortium report proposes using the continuing evolution of the spread-
sheet paradigm to frame a discussion about research into the usability of programming languages.
In particular it argues that research into programming language design needs to be hardened, and
should adopt a perspective similar to that described in The Prospects for Psychological Science in
Human-Computer Interaction (Newell & Card, 1985). In summary there are three components, the
need to work on good applied problems, using empirical studies to provide the basis for theories to
aid programming language designers."
