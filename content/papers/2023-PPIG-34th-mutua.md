title: "Interactive Narrative Visualization for Learning Markov Decision Process"
authors: [B. Mbuu Mutua, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "This paper asks how we can use visualization tools to help learners develop intuition on probabilistic
programming and how Markov Decision Processes (MDP) algorithm models problems in probabilistic
planning. The project seeks to address this question by presenting a novel pedagogical technique that
brings together visualization, use of interactive interfaces and a practical application of the semantic
wave theory in a learning environment. We also present an evaluation study with university students in
Kenya, focusing on use of narrative for teaching in that context."
