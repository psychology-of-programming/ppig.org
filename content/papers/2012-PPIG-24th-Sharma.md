title: "Gaze Evidence for Different Activities in Program Understanding"
authors: [Kshitij Sharma, Patrick Jermann, Marc-Antoine Nüssli, Pierre Dillenbourg]
abstract: "We present an empirical study that illustrates the potential of dual eye-tracking to detect successful
understanding and social processes during pair-programming. The gaze of forty pairs of programmers was
recorded during a program understanding task. An analysis of the gaze transitions between structural elements
of the code, declarations of identifiers and expressions shows that pairs with better understanding do less
systematic execution of the code and more “tracing” of the data flow by alternating between identifiers and
expressions. Interaction consists of moments where partners’ attention converges on the same same part of the
code and moments where it diverges. Moments of convergence are accompanied by more systematic execution
of the code and less transitions among identifiers and expressions."
