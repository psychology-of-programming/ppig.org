title: "Subsetability as a New Cognitive Dimension?"
authors: [Robert M. Dondero Jr., Susan Wiedenbeck]
abstract: "Subsetability is the ability to decompose programming languages and environments into a hierarchy of subsets, each of which can be used by stu-dents to create complete, meaningful computer programs. This paper argues that a programming language/environment's subsetability positively affects its learnability and teachability. The argument is supported by citing relevant theo-retical research, little of which is grounded in empirical studies. Then the paper goes on to argue that subsetability may be a new \"cognitive dimension of nota-tional systems,\" as defined by Green and Blackwell. It does so by analyzing subsetability in terms of Blackwell's criteria for dealing with new cognitive di-mensions."
