title: "Bots in Software Engineering and their impact on development"
authors: [Linda Erlenhov]
abstract: "Bots that support software development (\"DevBots\") are seen as a promising approach to deal with the
ever-increasing complexity of modern software engineering and development. Existing DevBots are
already able to relieve developers from routine tasks such as building project images or keeping
dependencies up-to-date. In this talk I will outline what what DevBots are, how developers use and
relate to bots, and will end with a few key takeaways:
<br>
- Not all tools that developers refer to as bots are utilising some type of AI/ML/NLP
<br>
- Software engineers expect to become “better” and “more productive” using DevBots
<br>
- Interactions need to be carefully thought out, especially due to the collaborative nature of DevBots"
