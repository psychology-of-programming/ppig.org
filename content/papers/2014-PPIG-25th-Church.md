title: "A Case of Computational Thinking: The Subtle Effect of Hidden Dependencies on the User Experience of Version Control"
authors: [Luke Church, Emma SÃ¶derberg, Elayabharath Elango]
abstract: "We present some work in progress based on observations of the use of version control systems in two different software development organizations. We consider the emergent user
experience, and analyze the structure of the conceptual model and its presentation to see how
this experience is formed. We consider its impact on the adoption of such tools outside software
engineering and suggest future lines of research."
