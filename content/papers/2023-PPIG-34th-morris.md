title: "Prompt Programming for Large Language Models via Mixed Initiative Interaction in a GUI"
authors: [Tanya A. Morris, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) now demonstrate many surprising capabilities that previously required
special algorithms, for example interactive correction of syntax errors in structured text. However, the
problem of how to systematically and reliably access these capabilities of LLMs has led to a new genre
of “prompt programming” or “prompt engineering”. This paper presents a design case study in which
we apply OpenAI’s Codex to an interface requiring syntax-constrained textual input, an email client. Via
a mixed-initiative interface design, the system provides appropriate suggestions based on the output of
the LLM. A user study was undertaken, finding that the incorporation of a LLM resulted in a decrease in
perceived workload as well as a 62.5% reduction in errors. This work demonstrates how mixed-initiative
interface design can better support attention investment in the use of LLMs, by delivering capabilities
that might otherwise require prompt programming in a chat dialogue, but via a relatively conventional GUI."
