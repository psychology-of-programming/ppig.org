title: "Project Kick-off with Distributed Pair Programming"
authors: [Edna Rosen, Stephan Salinger, Christopher Oezbek]
abstract: "<i>Background</i>: More and more software development companies decide to share their workload between
teams which are geographically distributed. One of the biggest challenges is to start up work when new
team members are introduced at a distant site of a global cooperation. Usually existing development processes
do not cover integrating distributed collaboration, hence there is a need to adjust them to make project starts
comfortable, easy and fast. A field study was conducted to introduce distributed pair programming (DPP), a
derivative of pair programming (PP) in a distributed context, as a new development method to support communication
and enhance knowledge transfer right from the beginning of the project. <i>Objective</i>: The objective
of the study was to uncover relevant procedures and problems of establishing DPP and to collect supporting
procedure steps for future project starts in distributed collaborations. <i>Methods</i>: A variation of canonical action
research (CAR) was used to both establish DPP, gather insights and allow feedback from the developers involved.
<i>Results</i>: This paper describes the establishment of DPP in a corporate project kick-off. It also reveals
some benefits and major problems about distributed collaboration like conflicts in role fulfillment, ambiguity
about session goals and missing awareness. <i>Limitations</i>: The validity of this study is threatened by the small
number of participants and their particular cultural backgrounds."
