title: "Designing a didactic model for programs and data structures"
authors: [Federico GÃ³mez, Sylvia da Rosa]
abstract: "Several authors affirm with solid arguments that it is essential to educate in computing, at least from secondary education and covering undergraduate courses, and that this continues to be a pending problem in most educational systems. Some point to the relationship between research and educational practice, which partly arises from the undervalued role of didactic research within the academy. Based on our epistemological model and taking as starting point fundamental ideas of computing, we began to develop a didactic model for the development of computational competencies and skills for novice students. In this paper we present the rationale of the proposed didactic model, a description of and empirical study and a preliminary analysis of the results of the experience."
