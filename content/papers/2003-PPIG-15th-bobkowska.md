authors: [Anna E. Bobkowska]
abstract: "In order to achieve more maturity in modelling languages engineering, effective methods of visual modelling language evaluation are required. There is growing understanding of human factors’ impact on the quality of results and thus cognitive perspective seems to be a good frame of reference for evaluation. In the paper, a case study of applying Cognitive Dimensions Questionnaire for visual modelling language evaluation is presented. Discussion of cognitive dimensions in context of its proposed use, analysis of the filled in questionnaires and responders’ opinions about the method as well as cross-comparison between set of cognitive dimensions and a set of criteria for visual modelling languages are described. Conclusions suggest need of customisation of the questionnaire with special focus on precision."
