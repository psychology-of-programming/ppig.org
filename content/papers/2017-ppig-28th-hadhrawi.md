title: "A Systematic Literature Review of Cognitive Dimensions"
authors: [Mohammad Hadhrawi, Alan F. Blackwell, Luke Church]
abstract: "We report a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), exploring the ways that the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations (CDs) framework has been applied since being proposed in 1989. We analyse over 1,600 publications that have cited key references in the CDs literature. Our research questions include 1) whether CDs are used as formative discussion tools or for summative evaluation; 2) which elements of the framework are most widely applied; and 3) the balance between applications and theoretical research contributions."
