title: "An Iterative Development Pattern to Learn Notional Machine and Programming Practices"
authors: [Charles Boisvert]
abstract: "This paper proposes to use iterative development — the use of incomplete or malfunctioning programs as part of problem resolution. It analyses how this pattern can applies in three Scratch exercises (a simple game, another in three dimensions, and a crank-rod mechanical simulation) that are well suited to present as iterative development problems, and shows how this presentation helps encourage learners to develop better programming practices and improve their notional machine — their mental model of code interpretation."
