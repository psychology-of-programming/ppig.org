abstract: "Automated teaching aids have become widespread during the last few
years also in the universities in Finland. Studies have been made on the impact
of these systems on the teaching results, and results have generally been encouraging.
In this research the general attitudes of students towards automated learning
environments and automated assessment are evaluated by surveys made to
the participants of two courses in which automated systems have been recently
adopted.
<br>
The research shows that automated systems are in general trusted and preferred
by the students. Independent of their own success, students consider automated
systems to be more professional and to treat the students equally. However, the
students did not endorse the adoption of automated systems without reservations:
developers and teachers need to remember the importance of human interaction
and to spend appropriate effort in evaluating the need for and the quality of automated
systems instead of adopting them without reservations."
