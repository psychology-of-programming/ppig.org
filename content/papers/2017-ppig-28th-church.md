title: "Scores & Scripts - a Bestiary of Intents"
authors: [Luke Church, Joana Chicau]
abstract: "A choreographer and a language designer collect and comment on a catalogue of notations of intent, each for their own purpose. We offer plural interpretations of their similarity, their purpose, their interpretation. The work is presented as a series of large posters each giving a different perspective of what it means to communicate intent."
