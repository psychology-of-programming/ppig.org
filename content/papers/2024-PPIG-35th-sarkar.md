title: "Intention is All You Need"
authors: [Advait Sarkar]
abstract: "Among the many narratives of the transformative power of Generative AI is one that sees in the world a latent nation of programmers who need to wield nothing but intentions and natural language to render their ideas in software. In this paper, this outlook is problematised in two ways. First, it is observed that generative AI is not a neutral vehicle of intention. Multiple recent studies paint a picture of the “mech- anised convergence” phenomenon, namely, that generative AI has a homogenising effect on intention. Second, it is observed that the formation of intention itself is immensely challenging. Constraints, ma- teriality, and resistance can offer paths to design metaphors for intentional tools. Finally, existentialist approaches to intention are discussed and possible implications for programming are proposed in the form of a speculative, illustrative set of intentional programming practices."
