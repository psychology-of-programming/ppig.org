title: "Comparison of Three Eye Tracking Devices in Psychology of Programming Research"
authors: [Seppo Nevalainen, Jorma Sajaniemi]
abstract: "Eye tracking can be used in measuring point of gaze data that provides information concerning subject’s focus of attention. The focus of subject’s attention can be used as supportive evidence in studying cognitive processes. Despite the potential usefulness of eye tracking in psychology of programming research, there exists only few instances where eye tracking has actually been used. This paper presents an experiment in which we used three eye tracking devices to record subjects’ points of gaze when they were studying short computer programs using a program animator. The results suggest that eye tracking can be used to collect relatively accurate data for the purposes of psychology of programming research. The results also revealed significant differences between the devices in the accuracy of the point of gaze data and in the times needed for setting up the monitoring process."
