title: "Exploring Core Cognitive Skills of Computational Thinking"
authors: [Ana Paula Ambrosio, Leandro da Silva Almeida, Joaquim Macedo, Amanda Franco]
abstract: "Although still innovative and not largely disseminated, Computational Thinking is being considered
as a critical skill for students in the 21st century. It involves many skills, but programming abilities
seem to be a core aspect since they foster the development of a new way of thinking that is key to the
solution of problems that require a combination of human mental power and computing power
capacity. This paper presents an exploratory study developed to select psychological assessment tests
that can be used to identify and measure Computational Thinking cognitive processes, associated to
the programming component, so that strategies can be developed to promote it. After the literature
review, we identified four central cognitive processes implied in programming, therefore important to
Computational Thinking, and accordingly selected a set of four tests that were administered to a
sample of 12 introductory programming students. Our results suggest that spatial reasoning and
general intelligence are crucial dimensions for introductory programming, being also correlated to the
studentsâ€™ academic success in this area. However, arithmetic reasoning and attention to detail tests did
not correlate. Based on these results, directions for future research have been defined in order to
effectively identify and develop the core cognitive processes of programming, ergo, to help develop
Computational Thinking."
