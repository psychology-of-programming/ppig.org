title: "Interactive Bayesian Probability for Learning in Diverse Populations"
authors: [Zainab Attahiru, Rowan Hall Maudslay, Alan F. Blackwell]
abstract: "This paper builds on work presented at PPIG 2021, “Visualising Bayesian Probability in the Kalahari”
(Blackwell et al., 2021). Here, we describe a proposed interface for visualising Bayesian probability
in a non-Western educational setting—in this case, a school in Nigeria. We evaluate the approach in a
school workshop combining didactic and discovery methods of learning. The results offer insights for
future curricula in high-school level probability, as well as an agenda for Computer Science education
research, exploring how a programming perspective (through model building) might improve reasoning
and intuition about probability."
