title: "Automatic, Suggestive Feedback in Algorithm Visualisation Exercises"
authors: [Artturi Tilanterä]
abstract: "This short paper discusses an ongoing doctoral research on the field of computing education research.
The subject is undergraduate computing education at universities: teaching basic data structures and
algorithms, meaning the principles of designing computer programs that solve tasks efficiently, without
wasting computing time or memory. The research aims to deepen knowledge on what are students’
difficulties in learning the subject, and how educational tools, such as visualisations and automatically
assessed exercises, could help the student. Published and preliminary results display the technical and
theoretical complexity of the subject."
