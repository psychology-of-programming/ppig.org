title: "Developing an experiment workbench to study software reuse from a cognitive perspective"
authors: [Fabrice Retkowsky]
abstract: "Software reuse, as a promising programming technique, has led to many technological developments. But it also involves programmers' cognition, and different theories compete as to how code reuse should be assisted by a computer tool. We decided to develop a reuse workbench, made of a reuse tool and an experiment toolkit, to simplify the evaluation of these various theories. We describe how we complemented the initial pen and paper design of the reuse tool by a simple experiment."
