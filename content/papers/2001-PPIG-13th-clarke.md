title: "Evaluating a new programming language"
authors: [Steven Clarke]
abstract: "We describe our efforts using the Cognitive Dimensions framework to evaluate a new programming language. We used a questionnaire approach to gather framework data related to the new language and combined this with a traditional lab-based evaluation. With this approach, we were able to validate the findings from the cognitive dimensions questionnaire by correlating them with the findings from the lab-based study. From this, we were able to determine if it is feasible to perform such an evaluation with usability participants who have no prior experience of the language being evaluated. Our findings have implications for anyone intending to use the cognitive dimensions to evaluate new notations or programming languages."
