title: "Rating expertise in collaborative software development"
authors: [Sallyann Bryant]
abstract: "The literature on expertise is wide-ranging, both across many domains and within software development, however when findings from these are contrasted with literature on experience in pair programming, some startling differences become apparent. For example, knowledge seems to be a key feature in obtaining expertise, however there is little mention of core programming knowledge as a measure of expertise in the pair programming literature. This paper discusses these discrepancies, along with findings on the reliability of various types of rating, to provide context for the presentation of data from a survey of commercial pair programmers which aims to help clarify what factors are considered good indicators of pair programming expertise by different groups."
