authors: [Christoph Becker, Tara Tsang, Rachel Booth, Enning Zhang, Fabian Fagerholm]
abstract: "Software projects teem with choices that have a temporal component – i.e. they involve uncertain future outcomes that are spread in time. In the field of Judgment and Decision Making, such decisions are called “Intertemporal Choice” situations. The board game “Undecided?” simulates a software project through a series of intertemporal choices made by a team decision. It is designed to be educational and fun, but its aim is to provide a platform for cognitive and social studies of decision making in software projects. This paper describes the game and outlines possible research designs."
