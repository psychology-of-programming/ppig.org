title: "The Systems Approach to Change and the Agile Software Development Context"
authors: [Lucas Gren]
abstract: "There is a diversity of models explaining organizational culture and how these complex aspects can
be addressed in connection to organizational change efforts. This workshop paper claims that models
already exist for dealing with the cultural change that an agile transition is in the software engineering
context. Instead of realizing this again through agile success stories, and thus reinventing the wheel, it
is argued that the research in the software engineering field should build on these models instead and
investigate how/if they differ. Practitioners already work as the change agents described in other fields
and they should get recognition through the presence and integration of these models in the software
engineering process research."
