title: "Applying Asynchronous Gaze Sharing and Social Navigation for Problem Solving Principles in an Programming Environment"
authors: [Fabian Deitelhoff]
abstract: "Simplex is a simplified language with a reduced set of keywords and abstractions. It can currently be used to write programs for the LEGO© Mindstorms© EV3. The idea is to enhance this language and the programming environment as part of a PhD project to use gaze sharing data and social navigation for problem solving principles in programming education."
