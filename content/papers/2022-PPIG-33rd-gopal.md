title: "POGIL-like learning and student’s impressions of software engineering topics: A qualitative study"
authors: [Bhuvana Gopal, Ryan Bockmon, Stephen Cooper]
abstract: "In this study, we analyze students’ impressions and perceptions of professional software engineering topics
and practices. We explore student thoughts on the interconnections between various industry relevant
software engineering topics such as requirements analysis, UI/UX, work patterns, agile communication,
documentation, and business value. We studied student voices in a semester long undergraduate software
engineering course, after they underwent instruction using POGIL-like, a guided inquiry based
pedagogy. At the end of the course, we collected student responses to open ended questions regarding
their perceptions of professional, end user software engineering topics. We combined student responses
to these questions with researcher memos as well as reflective researcher journals. We analyzed these
written responses using content analysis and identified the themes that the data yielded. The main themes
that emerged from our qualitative analysis were: 1) Software is more than just a tool to solve business
problems. 2) The need for documentation varies based on the process model adopted. 3) Timely and frequent
communication between team members and stakeholders is essential. 4) Downtime during work
is best used to further the sprint goals of the team or improve one’s technical acumen. We attempt to
understand if POGIL-like helped students develop a professionally sound understanding of basic software
engineering topics and how they work to get a software product developed, from requirements to
release."
