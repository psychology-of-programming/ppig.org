title: "Teaching Novice Programmers Programming Wisdom"
authors: [Randy M. Kaplan]
abstract: "Teaching students how to write computer programs has remained a challenge. Whether a student is new
to programming or has some experience they often have not had enough to develop strategies for solving
problems in a computer programming setting. It is akin to being in a rowboat without any oars. Yes, you
can get there; it will just take a long time.
<br>
There has been a great deal of research over the years into the psychological and cognitive aspects of
programming. The reality is that much of this research has not informed our teaching and we are still
teaching programming as we did many years ago. Although the academic community may take offense at
this statement looking at the way programming is taught today and applying the relevant research to the
process can justify it. Without going through that process, it remains easy to see. Programming is largely
taught today the way it was taught 60 years ago.
<br>
Although this paper is entitled “Teaching Novice Programmers Programming Wisdom,” the wisdom
referred to are encapsulations of some of the meta-skills that are needed to successfully write computer
programs. The list is not meant to be in anyway comprehensive, complete, or all encompassing. It is a list
used with some success in entry level programming courses. The purpose of writing and presenting the
idea of wisdom for programming is to allow the computer science/education/psychology communities to
comment on this wisdom and possibly offer other “nuggets” and approaches that might be employed
during novice programming instruction."
