title: "Mining Qualitative Behavioral Data from Quantitative Data: A Case Study from the Gender HCI Project"
authors: [Laura Beckwith, Thippaya Chintakovid, Susan Wiedenbeck, Margaret Burnett]
abstract: "Recent research has shown that gender differences exist that influence the ways that males and females work with problem-solving software. These gender differences may put females at a disadvantage in competing for jobs requiring these skills. Earlier research has shown the existence of gender differences in confidence that affects feature usage and adoption; however these findings have raised new questions. We are seeking answers to these questions through qualitative methods. The case study we present here documents our methodology and may be used as a guide for others embarking on similar qualitative analyses."
