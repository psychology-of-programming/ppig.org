title: "Java debugging strategies in multi-representational environments"
authors: [Pablo Romero, Benedict du Boulay, Richard Cox, Rudi Lutz]
abstract: "This paper reports the qualitative analysis part of a Java debugging
experiment. Java program debugging was investigated in computer
science students who used a software debugging environment (SDE) that
provided concurrently displayed, adjacent, multiple and linked
representations consisting of the program code, a visualisation of the
program, and its output.
<br>
The aim of this qualitative analysis was to characterise the
debugging strategies employed by participants, both at the level of focus
of attention and representation use as well as in terms of the general
reasoning strategy deployed. A modified version of the Restricted Focus
Viewer (RFV) - a visual attention tracking system - was employed to
measure the degree to which each of the representations was used, and
to record switches between representations.
<br>
The experimental results are in agreement with research in the area
that suggests that people start a debugging session by trying to
understand the code of the program before they attempt to locate any
bugs. Two different strategies to locate bugs were detected: by spotting
something odd in the program code and by comparing information from
the different external representations available. These strategies may be
linked to cognitive characteristics of the programmer such as level of
programming skill and display modality preference."
