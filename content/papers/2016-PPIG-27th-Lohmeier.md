title: "A Formal and a Cognitive Model of Anaphors in Java"
authors: [Sebastian Lohmeier]
abstract: "A formal and a cognitive model are in development to demonstrate the feasibility of programming with
direct and indirect anaphors. The formal model is based on the Eclipse IDE. The model generates
executable code, handles referential ambiguity, highlights anaphora relations, and permits programmers
to switch between source code with anaphors and normal Java code. The cognitive model will forecast
when a programmer will be able to understand specific indirect anaphors and when normal Java code
should be presented instead. Both models lay the foundation for indirect anaphors that are resolved at
edit-time and that shorten source code in cases when comprehensibility is expected to be maintained."
