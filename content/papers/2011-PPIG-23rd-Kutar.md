title: "The Cognitive Dimensions Questionnaire: Adapting for Non-Expert Users (Work-in-Progress)"
authors: [Maria Kutar, John Muirhead, Gordon Fletcher]
abstract: "The Cognitive Dimensions Framework provides an accessible route to understanding the properties of
information structures which may facilitate or hinder their usage. In this paper we report on the
adaptation of the Cognitive Dimensions Questionnaire to assist with the evaluation of The POS Store,
a software system. Although a Cognitive Dimensions Questionnaire has previously been developed to
facilitate use of the framework, and has been used in the evaluation of a number of systems, it was felt
that the user group in question would be more likely to provide meaningful data on The POS Store if
it were adapted to aim it towards the specific system under evaluation. We outline the motivation for
the changes, together with a summary of changes made, and discuss the potential implications of
adapting the questionnaire in this way."
