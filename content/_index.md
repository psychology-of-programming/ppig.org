The Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology.

On this website you can find information about the community, past workshops and an archive of previous news and other content.

(Please note that a website redesign is in progress - more content will be added soon, and if you find something that doesn't work properly, please [let us know](/contact)!)

Our next meeting is scheduled for 21-25 August 2023, and will be a hybrid virtual/physical meeting hosted by Lund University, Sweden. For more information, please check [the workshop page](/workshops/2023-annual-workshop).
