Writing limericks is an occasional pastime at PPIG workshops. These limericks were crowdsourced by attendees at the PPIG 2015 conference dinner.

Winning Limerick
================

A notation including space colon  
Is something a dog likes to roll on.  
It stinks out the lab,  
It flies like a crab.  
My manual lazy haves "stroll on".

V
=

A unicorn born with five legs,  
Laid manual\_lazy\_haves eggs.  
When asked what they were,  
He said with a purr,  
In Ruby say "colon space", dregs!

Cause for case
==============

In Pia-got-ian induction,  
A base case and stepwise production  
Created such flow  
You hardly would know  
How actions could cause such a ruction.

Pedantickes
===========

Let's obfuscate Clayton's semantics  
To stop his superlative antics.  
As far as I know,  
Mr. E. Allen Poe  
Did all but dismiss his pedantics.

Space colon
===========

A notation including space colon,  
Like something a dog likes to roll on.  
A test to declare,  
CDs are laid bare,  
Ruby's a bad part to found a whole on.

inRoot
======

There once was a naming convention,  
For identifiers, drawing attention  
To unparsable strings;  
Detestable things!  
A regularising invention.
