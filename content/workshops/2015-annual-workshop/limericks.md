Writing limericks is an occasional pastime at PPIG workshops. These limericks were crowdsourced by attendees at the PPIG 2015 conference dinner.

## Winning Limerick
A notation including space colon \
Is something a dog likes to roll on. \
It stinks out the lab, \
It flies like a crab. \
My manual lazy haves "stroll on".

## V
A unicorn born with five legs, \
Laid manual_lazy_haves eggs. \
When asked what they were, \
He said with a purr, \
In Ruby say "colon space", dregs!

## Cause for case
In Pia-got-ian induction, \
A base case and stepwise production \
Created such flow \
You hardly would know \
How actions could cause such a ruction.

## Pedantickes
Let's obfuscate Clayton's semantics \
To stop his superlative antics. \
As far as I know, \
Mr. E. Allen Poe \
Did all but dismiss his pedantics.

## Space colon
A notation including space colon, \
Like something a dog likes to roll on. \
A test to declare, \
CDs are laid bare, \
Ruby's a bad part to found a whole on.

## inRoot
There once was a naming convention, \
For identifiers, drawing attention \
To unparsable strings; \
Detestable things! \
A regularising invention.
