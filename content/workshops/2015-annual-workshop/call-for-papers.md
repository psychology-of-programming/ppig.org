Call for Papers

### Programming Online

With the importance placed on programming as an essential skill and the open availability of online courses, programming is increasingly engaging with a wider audience. Online materials engage with children (Scratch, Tynker.com, Code.org), through to university students, independent adult learners, second and subsequent language learners (CodeAcademy, W3Schools, Lynda.com; MOOCs, e.g. Coursera, edX). There is also a wealth of resources to support the online collaborative programmer (online forums, Stack Overflow, wikis). How does programming online impact upon the approaches, learning, tools, technologies and the interaction of programmers?

Also as ever PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience, and is equally concerned with all aspects of programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice.

Despite its title, PPIG is interested not only in psychology of programming and software engineering, but also in psychological aspects of related activities. Indeed, a feature of the PPIG workshops has always been their openness: although principally related to programming and software engineering, recent events have touched on learning mathematical formalisms, creativity and digital design, understanding websites, and live coding in the laptop music world. Similarly, PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological and social theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real‐world experience. We have open minds: if you think we might be interested, try us.

Some ideas to prompt you:

*   Empirical studies of programming
*   Programming education and skills acquisition
*   Programming and human cognition
*   Human Computer Interaction issues in programming
*   Collaborative programming
*   Software engineering methods, planning, estimation, agility etc.
*   Gender, age, culture and programming
*   New paradigms in programming
*   Code quality, readability and re‐use
*   Mistakes, bugs, and error handling

Other approaches and insights are welcome.

### Submission

Full Papers should be 12 pages or fewer.

Authors may also submit a 6-page Short Paper or a Work in Progress Report, clearly marked as such, to describe conjectural, late‐breaking or tentative results. The refereeing process will be suitably lighter.

As in previous years, the Programme Committee will review all submitted papers and, based on their reviews, each accepted paper will be classified as a "Full Technical Paper" or a "Work in Progress Report".

All papers accepted for presentation at PPIG 2015 will appear in the workshop proceedings and be archived on the PPIG website.

To format your paper, please use one of these templates: Word [.dotx](/sites/default/files/PPIG-submission-template.dotx) or [.doc](/sites/default/files/PPIG-submission-template.doc), [LaTeX (.zip)](http://ppig.org/sites/default/files/PPIG-submission-latex.zip)

Papers should be submitted in PDF format via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2015).

### Doctoral Consortium

The Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop will again host a doctoral consortium. The event is for research students at all stages of doctoral study. The event will include brief introductions by each of the student participants (of the order of 10 minutes, plus time for questions, depending on the number of students involved) and interactive sessions on the process and nature of PhD research.

Submission: applications must provide an overview of your research (max 6 pages) and should be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2015) as for other papers.

Research students are also requested to bring an A2/A3 poster presenting their work with them.

### Dates

**27** **April**: submission of draft Full and Short or Work in Progress papers

**25 May**: authors will be notified

**15 June**: submission of final camera‐ready copy

**1 June**: submission of Doctorial Consortium papers
