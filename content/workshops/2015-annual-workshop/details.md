## Things to do in Bournemouth

__The Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum__

Russell Cotes Road, Bournemouth, BH1 3AA

_In 1901, Merton Russell-Cotes gave his wife Annie a dream house on a cliff-top, overlooking the sea. It was an extraordinary, extravagant birthday present – lavish, splendid, and with a touch of fantasy.  They filled this exotic seaside villa with beautiful objects from their travels across the world, and lined the walls with a remarkable collection of British art, creating a unique atmosphere in a most dramatic setting. A home, an art gallery, and a museum. Then they sealed it in time, and gave it to the future._
