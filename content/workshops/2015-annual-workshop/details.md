Things to do in Bournemouth
===========================

![](http://ppig.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/ppig2015-6.jpg?itok=zx2VwLHy)**The Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum**  
Russell Cotes Road, Bournemouth, BH1 3AA

[www.russell-cotes.bournemouth.gov.uk](http://www.russell-cotes.bournemouth.gov.uk/)

_In 1901, Merton Russell-Cotes gave his wife Annie a dream house on a cliff-top, overlooking the sea. It was an extraordinary, extravagant birthday present – lavish, splendid, and with a touch of fantasy. They filled this exotic seaside villa with beautiful objects from their travels across the world, and lined the walls with a remarkable collection of British art, creating a unique atmosphere in a most dramatic setting. A home, an art gallery, and a museum. Then they sealed it in time, and gave it to the future._
