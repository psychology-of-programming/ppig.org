The 35th Annual Workshop of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) will take place on 5-6 September 2024 at the University of Liverpool, UK.

We're very happy to announce that we will be co-located with [VL/HCC](https://conf.researchr.org/home/vlhcc-2024), so you can anticipate some exciting shared sessions and interesting discussions!

As in previous years, we will aim to make it worthwhile to join us in Liverpool, but you will also have the alternative of presenting and interacting with presentations remotely from your home, office, tent or boat, as well as taking part in integrated online activities.


## THEME: Human agency in notations (programming,  AI, other… )

Through this year’s theme we invite authors to explore insights and resonances across and between programming (in the broadest sense) and people’s sense of agency in their interactions with complex computing systems. As a complementary theme to VL/HCC '24 special emphasis on Generative AI, we seek papers that in particular touch on:
* How can people’s sense of agency be supported in a world of programming and AI
* What challenges and opportunities different technologies pose for peoples’ experiences of agency, or lack of
* Notations that enhance or inhibit creativity and agency, and critiques of such notations
* Notations for agency and agency over notations
* Reflections and considerations on human agency, programming, and generative AI

As always, we especially encourage early ideas, works in progress, and thoughts still being fleshed out. We promise friendly and constructive discussions to help you hone your ideas.

And of course, any PPIG-relevant papers will be welcomed.


## BACKGROUND

PPIG was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology. “Programming”, here, is interpreted in the broadest sense to include any aspect of software creation. As always with PPIG, besides this year’s focus on human agency in notations, we welcome a wide range of submissions on a variety of topics, such as:

- Programming and human cognition
- Programming education and craft skill acquisition
- Human centred design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and infrastructure
- Team/co-operative work in programming
- End-user programming, end-user development
- Distributed programming, programming distribution
- Gender, age, culture and programming
- New paradigms in programming
- Code quality, readability, productivity and re-use
- Mistakes, bugs and errors
- Notational design
- Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming
- Non-human programming
- Technology support for creativity
- Music(al) programming
- Liveness and interactivity in programming

## DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM

This year’s PPIG DC will be held as a common meeting with the VL/HCC Graduate Consortium. Doctoral students are warmly invited to submit their work - the submission process can be found on the [VL/HCC website](https://conf.researchr.org/track/vlhcc-2024/vlhcc-2024-graduate-consortium).

Students who would benefit from financial support to attend the conference should get in touch with mariana.marasoiu@cst.cam.ac.uk.

## SUBMISSIONS

We welcome the following categories of submissions:

- Full Papers: usually less than 10 pages, but no set limit - as long as the reader’s interest is maintained
- Work-In-Progress papers: about 4 pages, but use more if needed
- Reflections, artworks, and system demonstrations: about 1 page as an extended abstract, with link(s) to photos/videos

**Please use [our templates](/author-resources/paper-templates) for papers. Submissions for the workshop should be uploaded to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2024).**

## IMPORTANT DATES

*Full papers* and *Work-in-Progress papers*:
* Abstract submission deadline: as soon as possible, at latest by **2 May 2024**
* Paper submission deadline: **30 May 2024**

*Reflections, artworks, and demos*:
* Submission deadline: **14 June 2024**.

## CONFERENCE FORMAT

This will be a hybrid physical/virtual meeting. As we will collocate with VL/HCC which will be in-person only in the first half of the week, we expect to adjust the hybrid schedule we’ve used in the past couple of years. More details as to the mix of activities and timings will be announced closer to time, so keep an eye out on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/ppig-announce) & [website](https://ppig.org/workshops/2024-annual-workshop/).
