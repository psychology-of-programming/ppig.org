| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/215.jpg" class="tr" >}} | Despite precautions at the door, |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/ws-2002-06-20.jpg" class="tr" >}} |  some delegates still succumbed to the incredible Shrinking Grins. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/maria-2002-06-18.jpg" class="tr" >}} | The workshop started with a talk by Maria Kutar, |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/break.jpg" class="tr" >}} | and the afternoon coffee break was full of discussion |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/rudi-lindsay.jpg" class="tr" >}} | and catching up. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/kit-2002-06-18.jpg" class="tr" >}} | Kit Logan's talk was followed by papers given by delegates |

| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/rosa2-2002-06-18.jpg" class="tr" >}} | whilst others were just caught. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/workshop-2002-06-19.jpg" class="tr" >}} | Day two of the workshop was eagerly awaited |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/room-2002-06-18.jpg" class="tr" >}} | and PPIG regulars took the opportunity to catch up |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-2002/thos-think.jpg" class="tr" >}} | on some reading of papers. |
