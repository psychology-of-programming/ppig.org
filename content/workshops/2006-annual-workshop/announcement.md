Aims and Scope
--------------

The annual PPIG workshop is a forum in which researchers concerned with cognitive factors in software engineering can present and discuss recent results, findings and developments.

A feature of the PPIG workshops has been their openness to a wide spectrum of concerns related to programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice.

Similarly, PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience. PPIG aims to bring together people working in a variety of disciplines and to break down cross-disciplinary barriers.

More information relating to paper submission deadlines will be distributed through the PPIG announce forum. More details will be available in the next newsletter.
