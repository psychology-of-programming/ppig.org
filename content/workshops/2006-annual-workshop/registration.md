This year PPIG'06 will be co-located with the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC'06) and the ACM Symposium on Software Visualization (SoftVis'06). Hence, in order to facilitate the registration process and create better options to our delegates, it has been decided to unify all three registrations.
