Paper submissions are now invited for the 18th Annual PPIG workshop to be held at Brighton, UK.

The annual PPIG workshop is a forum in which researchers concerned with psychological aspects of software development can present and discuss recent results, findings and developments. Despite its name PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience, and is equally concerned with all aspects of programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice.

PPIG aims to bring together people working in a variety of disciplines and to break down cross-disciplinary barriers. If you have any queries as to whether your topic falls within the remit of PPIG, then please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair, Dr Pablo Romero.

Subsidy for students wishing to attend this event is available. Please contact Maria Kutar for details on this.

This year, PPIG'06 will be co-located with the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing ([VL/HCC'06]http://www.cmis.brighton.ac.uk/vlhcc/)) and the ACM Symposium on Software Visualization ([SoftVis'06](http://www.softvis.org/)). All these conferences have many relevant topics for those interested in the psychological aspects of software development and therefore this is a great opportunity to leverage travel time/money.
