PPIG Workshop: 

[2009-01-WIP](/workshop/ppig-wip-workshop-2009)

_Centre for Research in Computing, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK  
8-9 January 2009_

The Psychology of Programming Group (PPIG) invites software engineers and researchers to submit abstracts for its **5th [Work-in-Progress meeting](/node/261)**, to be held at the Centre for Research in Computing at the Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.

The PPIG work-in-progress workshop is a forum in which researchers at all levels can present and discuss current work and recent results, findings and developments concerned with psychological aspects of software development. A feature of the PPIG workshops has been their openness to a wide spectrum of concerns related to programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice. Similarly, PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience.

Papers should address issues related to cognitive or social aspects of programming and/or analysis of software development behaviours. If you are not sure that your topic is suitable for the workshop, you are welcome to send an email to Gabriela Pavel (G.Pavel (at) open.ac.uk).

Experienced researchers and practitioners, as well as doctoral students, are equally invited to submit.

Looking forward to meeting you at the Open University.
