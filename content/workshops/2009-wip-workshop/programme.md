Invited Speaker
---------------

[Dr. Jim Buckley](http://www.csis.ul.ie/staff/JimBuckley/) is a lecturer at the University of Limerick, Ireland. His research interests are related to the investigation of programmers' information needs in the process of software evaluation.

**Topic:** Software Visualization: Did anyone ask what the software developers want?

> Software visualization is the sub-field of information visualization concerned with the visual representation of typically large, complex software systems. It is used to convey structural, behavioural and historical information about these software systems to stakeholders such as system architects, programmers, and maintainers. In this talk, I will give a brief overview of the field, present several 'state-of-the-art' software visualization techniques and discuss several key issues in this field, primarily to do with the complexity and scale of the information to be visualized.
> 
> I will argue that this arena has been dominated by these complexity issues neglecting, to a larger degree, the requirements of the customers (the system stakeholders identified above). Thus I will review the literature on programmers' information seeking, highlighting some stereotypical information needs of programmers that have been identified in this literature. Using these needs as our requirements, we will revisit the software visualization techniques and see if we can come up with some suggestions for congruent visualizations.
