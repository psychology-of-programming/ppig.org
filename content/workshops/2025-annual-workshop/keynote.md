## Keynote: Language and Mind: A Complex Dynamic Relation

by Dušica Filipović Đurđević, University of Belgrade

### Abstract

Understanding how information is represented and processed in the human mind is one of the fundamental goals across psychology, computational science, neural studies, philosophy, and cognitive science. Analyzing the structure of language alongside its cognitive processing can yield insights into mental functioning, based on the premise that the properties of the cognitive system shape language. This perspective suggests that language has evolved as an efficient communication system optimized for learning, as well as for representation and retrieval in the human mind. In my talk, I will argue that language serves as a window into human information processing and representation, illustrating these ideas with examples from my research on phonological, morpho- syntactic, and semantic dimensions of language processing. Furthermore, I will explore the relationship between human language and programming languages, emphasizing the distinction between natural and artificial systems. I will advocate that human language, as a natural system, eludes complete description by a finite set of rules. Finally, I will invite discussion on the implications of the difference for human interaction with these two systems, as well as its practical ramifications on the design of programming languages and user interfaces.

### Bio

[Dušica Filipović Đurđević](https://dusicafilipovicdurdevic.net/) is a Full Professor at the Department of Psychology, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Belgrade. She earned her Ph.D. from the University of Belgrade in 2007, and furthered her education with visits to the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen in 2006 and the University of Oxford in 2008. Her research is conducted at the Laboratory for Experimental Psychology in both Belgrade and Novi Sad. Dušica focuses on understanding the relationship between language, learning, and memory, emphasizing both intra-linguistic distributional information and the connections between language and perceptual experiences.

## Panel: How do socio-psychological methods for programming languages work in industry?

This panel will include short presentations from JetBrains researchers at the intersection between psychology and programming, such as using cognitive research for language design, and increasing developer empathy through anthropological research. This will be followed by an open discussion seeking to understand the different perspectives, how PPIG research is used in practice, what works well, and where there might be new opportunities.
