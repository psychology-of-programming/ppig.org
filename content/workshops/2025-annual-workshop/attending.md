## Visa Information

Serbia offers visa-free entry for citizens of many countries. However, some nationalities may require a visa.

[Check the official visa requirements at Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.](https://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/citizens/travel-serbia)

Foreign visitors are required to register their residence with the local police within 24 hours of arrival, regardless of the purpose of their stay. There is no cost to register. Hotels and similar accommodations should handle this automatically upon check-in, but those staying in private residences must register themselves. If you have any doubts, please ask at the registration desk.

## Local Currency and Payments

The local currency is the Serbian Dinar (RSD), but most restaurants and shops will also accept euros (EUR). Bringing mostly EUR in cash with some small amounts of RSD for public transport etc. should work well.

ATMs and currency exchange offices are widely available. Most restaurants and shops accept major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Maestro; AmEx has limited availability)

# Student protests in Serbia

Serbia is currently seeing a series of peaceful protests calling for full transparency and accountability over the collapse of a concrete and glass canopy at the station in Novi Sad which had been renovated and reopened briefly just before the incident.

The protests have been carried out largely by students and have been peaceful to date. The students’ movement has even been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize recently.

For more information about the reasons behind the protests you can read [this analysis](https://unipd-centrodirittiumani.it/en/topics/what-happens-when-students-unite-for-justice-the-pulse-of-serbian-protests) and [this news article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/06/serbias-students-showing-world-democratic-hope).

As conference organizers, we are monitoring the situation closely. The protests are still ongoing, but throughout the whole time they have been peaceful, with no violence or safety issues being experienced by non-participants. From today's perspective (15 July 2025) we do not foresee any risks related to the protests for prospective conference attendees.

If you have any concerns about travelling to Belgrade, feel free to get in touch and check your government's travel advisory.
