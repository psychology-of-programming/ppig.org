The 36th Annual Workshop of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) will take place on **8-12 September**. This will be a hybrid virtual/physical meeting hosted by **JetBrains Research in Belgrade, Serbia**.

As in previous years, we will aim to make it worthwhile to join us in Belgrade, but you will also have the alternative of presenting and interacting fully with all presentations remotely from your home or office, as well as taking part in integrated hybrid activities.

## THEME: Intersections

PPIG has always been a meeting place, of ‘psychology’ and ‘programming’, but also of people and programming, crafts and programming, computers and people.

Serbia more broadly and Belgrade in particular have always been at the confluence of wider things, between West and East, creativity and science, tradition and modernity. These intersections can still be seen today in city planning, architecture, culture, food and spirit.

To celebrate this, in 2025 we’ll consider _intersections_ - places where more than one idea meet and overlap, and the role they play in the evolution of programming.

For instance, papers might consider aspects such as:

- Programming as a socio-technical system
- Programming as interchange between physical and digital systems
- Interdisciplinary design methods for and with programming
- Co-design methodologies for programming languages
- Transgression and its role in programming
- Transhumanism and programming of the future in the present

Of course, as ever, any PPIG-relevant papers will be welcomed.

## BACKGROUND:

PPIG was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology. “Programming”, here, is interpreted in the broadest sense to include any aspect of software creation. PPIG is a diverse community with diverse interests. As always with PPIG, besides this year’s theme of ‘intersections’, we welcome a wide range of submissions on a variety of topics, such as:

- Programming and human cognition
- Programming education and craft skill acquisition
- Human-centred design and evaluation of programming languages, languages, tools, and infrastructure
- Team/co-operative work in programming
- End user programming
- Distributed programming, programming distribution
- Gender, age, culture and programming
- New paradigms in programming
- Code quality, readability, productivity and re-use
- Mistakes, bugs and errors
- Notational design
- Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming
- Non-human programming
- Technology support for creativity
- Music(al) programming
- Liveness and interactivity in programming

## DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM:

Doctoral students are warmly invited to submit work to the PPIG Doctoral Consortium, which has gained a reputation for being helpful, constructive and unthreatening.

Students who would benefit from support to attend the conference should get in touch with mariana.marasoiu@cst.cam.ac.uk.

## SUBMISSIONS:

We welcome the following categories of submissions:

- Full Papers: usually less than 10 pages, but no explicit limit as long as the reader’s interest is maintained
- Short Work-In-Progress papers: about 4 pages, but use more if needed
- Doctoral Consortium submissions: about 2 pages, but use more if needed
- Reflections, Artworks, and System Demonstrations: typically a 1 page extended abstract

**Please use [our templates for papers](/author-resources/paper-templates/). Submissions for the workshop should be uploaded to [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2025).**

## IMPORTANT DATES:

_Full papers_ and _Work-in-Progress papers_:

- Abstract submission deadline: **5 May 2025**
- Paper submission deadline: **2 June 2025**

_Doctoral Consortium_ and _Reflections, artworks and demos_ extended abstracts:

- Submission deadline: **1 July 2025**

_Authors will be notified_: as soon as possible, by **7 July 2025** at the latest

_Conference_: **8-12 September 2025**

_Camera-ready submission deadline_: **1 October 2025**

- PPIG uses a post-proceedings process, so that authors can incorporate the workshop discussion and feedback into their final paper.

## CONFERENCE FORMAT:

We’re planning for a hybrid physical/virtual meeting consisting of a full week of paper presentations and keynotes in the afternoons available for both in-person and online attendees, and 2-3 days of in-person only activities in the first few days of the week \- a format that worked successfully in recent years. Details of the mix of activities and day to day timings will be provided closer to the time, so keep an eye out on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/ppig-announce) & [website](https://ppig.org/workshops/2025-annual-workshop/).

We look forward to your submissions and participation!
