A work-in-progress meeting of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21-22 February, 2008  
Department of Informatics, University of Sussex, UK

Paper submissions are now invited for the PPIG work-in-progress workshop.

The Psychology of Programming Interest Group are holding the 4th work-in-progress workshop at the University of Sussex on 21-22 February 2008.

The PPIG work-in-progress workshop is a forum in which researchers at all levels can present and discuss current work and recent results, findings and developments concerned with psychological aspects of software development. A feature of the PPIG workshops has been their openness to a wide spectrum of concerns related to programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice. Similarly, PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience.

This informal workshop is intended to foster exchange of ideas and constructive suggestions for research in progress. Doctoral students and more experienced researchers will be equally welcome.

PPIG aims to bring together people working in a variety of disciplines and to break down cross-disciplinary barriers. If you have any queries as to whether your topic falls within the remit of PPIG, then please do not hesitate to contact the Local Chair, Johanna Hunt at J.M.Hunt (at) sussex.ac.uk
