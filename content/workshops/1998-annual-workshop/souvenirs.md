| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p20.jpg" class="h6">}} | ...to PPIG's 10th Workshop. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p12.jpg" class="h6">}} | The rest of the afternoon was spent listening to the opening papers and the invited talk. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p15.jpg" class="h6">}} | That evening in the Cellar Bar, we had the opportunity to meet people who had come to the UK for the the workshop from all over the world. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p14.jpg" class="h6">}} | We also enjoyed folk music played by Thomas Green (flute), Mark Simos (fiddle) and Alan Blackwell (double bass). |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p34.jpg" class="h6">}} | The next day, we gathered again... |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p13.jpg" class="h6">}} | ...to listen to a selection of papers... |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p10.jpg" class="h6">}} | ...and the second invited talk. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p8.jpg" class="h6">}} | That evening, we were treated to the Workshop dinner... |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p9.jpg" class="h6">}} | ...and stimulating conversation. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p39.jpg" class="h6">}} | Returning to the hotel, we found ourselves drawn to the bar. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p6.jpg" class="h6">}} | Enjoying our drinks,... |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p7.jpg" class="h6">}} | ...we noticed the piano player, who took our song requests in good humour. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p5.jpg" class="h6">}} | It wasn't long before the piano player was joined by someone else,... |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p4.jpg" class="h6">}} | ...to the delight of the others in the bar. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p3.jpg" class="h6">}} | The others soon joined in the music-making. |

| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p2.jpg" class="h6">}} | ...and we all listened to Mark Simos playing the piano and singing folk songs. |
| {{< figure src="img/ppig-1998/p40.jpg" class="h6">}} | After some time of musical merriment, the piano player left us... |
