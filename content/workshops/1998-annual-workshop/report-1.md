PPIG 1998 Report #1
===================

**[10th Annual Workshop](/node/104)**  
5-7 January 1998  
Knowledge Media Institute, Open University, UK

The tenth PPIG workshop was held at the Open University in the then rather windy town of Milton Keynes. A range of programming related topics were covered by the speakers, including software maintenance and reuse, program comprehension, imagery, syntonicity, tools for novices, programming paradigms and transfer. A list of the papers in shown below. The two invited speakers were Allen Cypher and Alexander Repenning.

Allen Cypher talked about CoCoa, a visual programming environment for children, and latest developments allowing the children to share their programs over the web. Allen described how CoCoa has been tested and refined over the years, through its use in schools.

Alexander Repenning talked of the challenges of end-user programming in a world were computer mediated communication is becoming ever more important.

Alex demonstrated Agentsheets, an agent-based spreadsheet environment, allowing people to create web-based interactive simulations. Both speakers gave enthralling talks and made full use of the technical facilities in the new cinema-style lecture theatre.

On the social side there was a pub meal, a traditional folk-style jam, plus the usual array of unusual prizes, and some birthday cake for those who made it to the end.
