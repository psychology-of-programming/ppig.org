Enjoying our drinks,...

...we noticed the piano player, who took our song requests in good humour.

It wasn't long before the piano player was joined by someone else,...

![](/sites/default/files/p4.jpg)

...to the delight of the others in the bar.

The others soon joined in the music-making.

The piano player soon needed a rest...

![](/sites/default/files/p2.jpg)

...and we all listened to Mark Simos playing the piano and singing folk songs.

After some time of musical merriment, the piano player left us...

![](/sites/default/files/p41.jpg)

...to entertain ourselves.

Music was played late into the night by the Mighty Alan Blackwell on double bass,...

...and the Multi-Talented Mark Simos on piano and fiddle.
