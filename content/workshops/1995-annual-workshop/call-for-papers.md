## PPIG Workshop: 4-6 January 1995
University of Edinburgh, Scotland

The annual PPIG workshop is an opportunity for researchers from both academia and industry to meet to discuss current ideas, research, techniques, and tools in the psychology of software engineering. The workshop format will be tailored according to the submissions but is likely to include paper presentations, discussion sessions, demonstrations, and posters, as well as ample time for informal discussion. Speakers have been invited from North America and France. The programme will be announced in December.

Topics discussed in previous workshops have included: empirical studies of novice and expert programmers, collaborative software development, graphical notations and environments, teaching and learning programming, errors, debugging, tracers and visualization, mental models, parallelism, programming paradigms, display-based reasoning, software design methodologies, programming environments and support tools, organizational issues, formal reasoning, specification. Still room for more!

Attendance will be limited to a maximum of 40 delegates and is not restricted to PPIG members.

**Organizers:**
Ben du Boulay (Sussex)
Thomas Green (MRC APU)
Helen Pain (Edinburgh) (local organizer)

**Venue:**
Meetings will take place in the Dept of Artificial Intelligence, Edinburgh. For those who don't know it, Edinburgh is justifiably renowned for its beautiful buildings, its winding hilly streets, its romantic past, its many tourist shops, its even many-er bars, and of course its contributions to the sciences and the arts. PPIG will be right at home.
