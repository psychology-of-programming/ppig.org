Preliminary Details
-------------------

**[PPIG 2008](/node/114)** is due to take place at Lancaster University, UK in the autumn of 2008. An announcement about the date and the first call for papers will be made in early 2008.
Lancaster is a small, historic city in the North West of the UK. Attractions include an imposing medieval castle, one of the finest parks in the UK, and beautiful countryside and coastline. Lancaster is within easy reach of Manchester to the south and the Lake District (home of Beatrix Potter, and romantic poets such as Wordsworth and Coleridge) to the north.

We look forward to seeing you there!
