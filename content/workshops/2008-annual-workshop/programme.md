### 14.00: Conference Opening and Keynote 1
**Keynote speaker: Alan Dix (Lancaster University)**

> **As We May Code - The art (and craft) of computer programming in the 21st century**
>
> It is now 50 years since Knuth published the first volume of "The art of computer programming". This and the succeeding volumes (still being produced) form the definitive and monumental achievement in traditional algorithmics. However, the practice of programming has changed dramatically in recent years. Some changes are obvious: the use of technology in coding - from coding forms and punch cards to IDEs; the languages for coding - from Fortran and assembler to JavaScript and bytecode; and even the paradigms of coding - from procedures to objects. However, there are also more subtle, and possibly more fundamental changes that transform the way coders now think about their code and the very act of coding and hence affect centrally the understanding of the psychology of programming. In this talk I will try to draw out some of these changes writing from experience as a HCI 'expert', as a teacher and, perhaps most importantly, as a coder.

# Thursday 11th September

### 09.15: Keynote 2
**Keynote Speaker: Margaret-Anne Storey (University of Victoria)**

> **Source Code Comments: Graffiti or Information?**
>
> Source code is a formal, unambiguous language that is both machine and human readable. Source code comments, on the other hand, enhance only human understanding and communication by providing additional information about the system and the processes used to develop it. Interestingly, many developers either hate or love comments, while others add them to their programs but often in an ad hoc manner. In this talk, I will explore the role of source code comments on program comprehension, referring to both the cognitive and social aspects of how they are used. First, I will review theories and studies, some that are now over 30 years old, which capture what we know today on this topic. Next I will describe our ongoing work that investigates how source code comments and annotations support reminding and refinding in software development. Finally, I will conclude by proposing that more empirical and social studies on how comments influence program comprehension are needed. I will also put forward ideas for improved tool support for authoring, navigating and managing source code comments.

### 15.30 - 17.30: Tutorials

_These tutorials are to be run in parallel and are free to conference delegates_

**Tutorial: Luke Church (University of Cambridge) and Thomas Green (University of Leeds)**

> **The Cognitive Dimensions of Notation**
>
> The CDs framework provides
> * a standardised framework of 'cognitive dimensions', each relating to usability experience,
> * where each dimension is (more or less) independent of each of the others,
> * applying to every kind of information artefact (i.e. anything used for storing or manipulating or accessing information - that's most non-natural things);
> * a background in the experimental literature of cognitive psychology relating to each of the dimensions;
> * a high-level classification of the activities people get up to with technology;
> * and an attempt to say, for each activity, which cognitive dimensions are critical to making that activity successful.

<br>

**Tutorial: Dave Randall (Manchester Metropolitan University) and Mark Rouncefield (Lancaster University).**

> **Fieldwork for Design**
>
> Participants will learn the relevance of theoretical perspectives to the practice of fieldwork (ethnography), and to the problem of capturing social complexity.
> * The practical problems, strategies and choices of the fieldworker in performing observational studies will be discussed.
> * Experiences gleaned from a range of studies in commercial and industrial settings, domestic environments and public spaces - will be examined. For this tutorial there will be a particular emphasis on studies of systems developers.
> * Problems of method, communication and comprehension in collaborations between ethnographer and system developer will be presented.
> * There will be online access to comprehensive notes and an annotated bibliography. It will review and build on existing literature on ethnography, systems design, and change management but will endeavour to maintain a practical focus.

### 14.00: Keynote 3
**Keynote Speaker: Adrian Mackenzie (Lancaster University)**

> **"We want to do for biology what Intel does for electronics": re-factoring biology as a software engineering enterprise.**
>
> The paper describes certain trends in the field of synthetic biology or 'synbio' from the perspective of software engineering practices. The nascent field of synbio is relying heavily on software engineering approaches such as modularity, platforms, registries, libraries, standards and re-factoring to develop technologies such as biofuels, drugs, assays, biosensors and crops. The idea is that shared codifications of techniques and processes of biological engineering will lead to an accelerating rate of invention in biology. As well as invoking software engineering as a design philosophy to be 'ported' into biology, the everyday practices of synbio are saturated by web software cultures of collaboration and participation (wikis, blogs) as well as relying on web-based technical services (such as DNA synthesis, sequences database and searching tools). One analytical question for sociologies of synbio would be: does the model of software engineering and design abstraction begins to break down in synbio? Based on a small case study of two different synbio projects, this paper will sketch a preliminary answer to that question.
