PPIG 2008, the twentieth Psychology of Programming Interest Group workshop, will be held at Lancaster University, UK on the 10th, 11th and 12th of September 2008.

See the workshop website: www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ppig08

The annual PPIG (Psychology of Programming Interest Group) workshop is a forum in which researchers concerned with psychological aspects of software development can present and discuss recent results, findings and developments.


### Call for Papers:

We invite papers concerned with psychological aspects of software development. PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience, and is equally concerned with all aspects of programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice. If you have any queries as to whether your topic falls within the remit of PPIG, then please do not hesitate to contact the Programme Chair.

Themes can include, but are not limited to:

* Empirical studies of programming
* Programming education and skills acquisition
* Human centred design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and
infrastructure
* Programming and human cognition
* Human Computer Interaction issues in programming
* Team/cooperative work in programming
* End user programming
* Distributed programming, globalisation, work in large teams
* Free/libre open source software development
* Software engineering methods, planning, estimation, agility etc.
* Gender, age, culture and programming
* New paradigms in programming
* Code quality, readability and re-use
* Mistakes, bugs, and error handling
* Working with notation
* Specialist and domain centred programming tools and languages

Other approaches and insights are welcome...

**Submission**: For submission details see www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ppig08

**Deadline**: 1st May 2008

### Doctoral Consortium:

The Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop will again host a doctoral consortium. The event is for research students at all stages of doctoral study. The event will include brief introductions by each of the student participants (on the order of 10 minutes, plus time for questions, depending on the number of students involved) and interactive sessions on the process and nature of Ph.D. research. Experienced researchers, in addition to the organisers, will participate as 'discussants' to add different perspectives and to provide feedback on individual research programmes.

**Submission**: For submission details see www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ppig08

**Deadline**: 31st July 2008
