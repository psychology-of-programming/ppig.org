The 30th Annual Meeting of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group will be held between 28th-30th August at Newcastle University, UK.

Following last year’s successful engagement with craft and art, this year we are particularly interested in aspects of interdisciplinarity. The Psychology of Programming is itself an interdisciplinary effort, as well as a multi-disciplinary effort. Previous discussions have substantially engaged with other disciplines, including education, engineering, music, magic, data analysis, collaboration and creativity, and yet there are so many other fields left to consider. Perhaps now is the time to consider the psychology of animal programming?

We also welcome research that discusses the psychology of programming in the wider context, drawing on issues such as sustainability, economy, politics, media, culture and society.

We have open minds, and enjoy conversations around creative and risky ideas more than polished 'correctness'. If you think we might be interested, give us a try.

As it’s our 30th birthday, we’re thinking about how to put together a special programme. Details to follow.

As usual, we welcome the following categories of submissions:

- Papers: 1-10 pages long
- System demonstrations and reflections: an abstract, video, or artwork outlining what you will present. Crashes are desirable. Up to 2.5 days long.
- Doctoral consortium submissions: Up to 2 pages long.

**Please use [our templates](author-resources/paper-templates) for papers. Submissions for the workshop should be uploaded to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2019).**

If you’re stuck to think of things we might find interesting, here are some themes to prompt:

- Music(al) programming
- Liveness and interactivity in programming
- Programming education and craft skill acquisition
- Human centered design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and infrastructure
- Programming and human cognition
- Team/co-operative work in programming
- End user programming
- Distributed programming, programming distribution
- Culture and programming
- New paradigms in programming
- Code quality, readability, productivity and re-use
- Mistakes, bugs and errors
- Notational design
- Data programming
- Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming
- Non-human programming
- Technology support for creativity

Looking forwards to seeing you there,
Lindsay, Luke, Mariana
