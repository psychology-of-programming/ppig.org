## Registration

Registration is now open [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ppig-2022-registration-395345578267)!

## CONFERENCE FORMAT
Rather than 2 Â½ full days, the usual pre-covid format, we shall meet for a full week of part days, a format that worked very successfully in 2020 and 2021. Online, the part day sessions will be from 4pm to ~~6pm~~ 6.30pm British Summer Time (= UTC plus 1 hour) every day, which will include all conference keynotes and presentations.

For those able to attend physically, the onsite activities at The Open University will extend over two and a half days from Monday morning to Wednesday lunchtime. On the first two days, social activities during the day will be focused on convivial participative hands-on physical activities designed to be enjoyable and rewarding in their own right,  and to promote reflection on issues of foundational interest to PPIG. On Tuesday afternoon there will be a group visit to the National Museum of Computing, and on Wednesday morning there will be a group visit to Bletchley Park. However the tickets for Bletchley Park allow multiple visits, so attendees will have the option to visit earlier (or later) during the week. We hope this gives folks complete flexibility in departure times for homeward travel on Wednesday.

For any attendees who wish to remain onsite for the rest of the week, the conference room at the OU will continue to be available between 4pm - 6pm Wednesday to Friday for communal online participation.

*Note*: Doctoral Consortium participants will be contacted separately by Marian and Clayton as to when it will take place, one option being considered is the afternoon of Sunday the 4th.

## Mode of attendance
If you have not already done so, please could presenters email simon.holland AT open.ac.uk as soon as possible to indicate whether you plan to **present physically or online**, as we need this information to **finalise the details of the schedule for presentations**.


## Length of Presentations
Presentations for both full papers and Works in Progress will be **15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions and discussion**. Speakers are encouraged to aim for shorter presentations than the maximum given and thus leave even more time than 5 minutes for discussion to make the most out of the conversation about their work with friendly researchers in the field. Keynotes are 40 minutes including questions.


## Tools for conviviality
If you are attending PPIG physically, please consider bringing both a laptop and a tablet (or similar pair of capable devices) as this can help hybrid engagement and inclusion. So, for example, if you tend to use one device to take notes during presentations, you could use the other to act as a personal microphone and camera if you happen to ask a question, or to let those at home to get alternative views of what is happening. (A laptop or tablet will also be useful during some of the convivial participative hands-on physical activities on Monday and Tuesday.)
