# PPIG 2022 - Turing, Piaget, Radiohead: PPIG and the Muse

The 33nd Annual Meeting of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) will take place from 5th to 9th September 2022.  This will be a hybrid virtual/physical meeting hosted by The Open University (Milton Keynes, UK).  We aim to make it strongly worthwhile to join us in  Milton Keynes, but you will also have the alternative of presenting and interacting fully with all presentations remotely from your home or office, as well as taking part in integrated online activities. Details of the mix of activities and day to day timings will be provided closer to the time.

## THEME:

This year’s theme is  ‘Turing, Piaget, Radiohead: PPIG and the Muse’, considering insights and resonances between and across programming (broadly interpreted), psychology, and music.
So, for example, papers might draw inspiration regarding:
* Creativity (including muses, metaphors, and inspiration)
* Notations and annotations
* Sensory-motor experience
* Craft skills
* Evolution and adaptation of works
* Liveness and interactivity

The goal is to draw inspiration and metaphors from music and the arts to cast light on anything to do with programming in the PPIG context. Sources of inspiration could include any aspect of music, e.g.: listening to, playing, and composing music; music psychology;  music computing; ethnomusicology; musical communities and music economics; the future of music.  Similarly, inspiration from any other arts, or from sensory-motor skills and experiences more generally, would be very welcome.

Of course, as ever, any PPIG-relevant papers will be welcomed.

## BACKGROUND:

PPIG was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology. “Programming”, here, is interpreted in the broadest sense to include any aspect of software creation. As always with PPIG, besides this year’s theme of games, we accept the widest range of submissions on a variety of topics, such as:

- Programming and human cognition
- Programming education and craft skill acquisition
- Human centred design and evaluation of programming languages, languages, tools and infrastructure
- Team/co-operative work in programming
- End user programming
- Distributed programming, programming distribution
- Gender, age, culture and programming
- New paradigms in programming
- Code quality, readability, productivity and re-use
- Mistakes, bugs and errors
- Notational design
- Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming
- Non-human programming
- Technology support for creativity
- Music(al) programming
- Liveness and interactivity in programming

## DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM:

Doctoral students are warmly invited to submit work to the doctoral consortium, which has gained a reputation for being helpful, constructive and unthreatening. Doctoral students who would benefit from support to attend the conference should get in touch with mariana.marasoiu@cl.cam.ac.uk.
