## Icebreaker game: "not no-one, not everyone"

It's never all-or-none, quite the opposite! The goal of this game is to get to know each other by finding things we have in common.

We'll each take turns introducing a website that we have visited and that we think that at least one other person in attendance has also visited, *but not everyone*. Sticklers will aim for a very small number of others to know of the website, rather than most. If no one else has visited that website other than you, oops - you will be deducted some points (just kidding, there's no score, just good fun!)

Feel free to think about this in advance, or if you're feeling brave, come up with one on the spot!
