Thanks to all who attended and made PPIG 2020 Summer edition such a success!

The autumn session which will take place 16th to 20th November, and we’ll be continuing with the threads started in August. If you have any thoughts inspired by the discussions so far, any reflections or early ideas that you’d like to explore and discuss further in November, we’re still accepting submissions.

Your contributions can be in the form of papers (full or work in progress), short doctoral consortium submissions, postcards, artwork, system demonstration, or any form you think would best suit.

The timeline for submissions is **1st of October** for just the title and abstract of your contribution, and **8th of October** for the full submission. The [unified EasyChair instance for PPIG 2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2020) is open for the Autumn edition as well, and please aim to use our [paper templates](https://ppig.org/author-resources/paper-templates/).
