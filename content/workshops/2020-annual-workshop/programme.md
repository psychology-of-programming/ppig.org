PPIG 2020 will take place as two one-week-long virtual events in August (17th to 21st) and November (16th to 20th). During each of the two weeks, we'll meet for two to three hours a day for presentations, discussions, panels and social activities.

Below is the programme for the Summer session. We’ll be meeting each day starting at 4pm UK / 11am Eastern / 8am Pacific for about 2 hours of scheduled content, followed by up to one extra hour of social activities. There will be about 5-10 minute breaks between each hour of scheduled content. You can find here a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=v3ls355gbssl9kfsdm8dc9h4ok%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) you can subscribe to.

It's free to attend, and you will need to register via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ppig-2020-tickets-112513984356) so we can share the virtual meeting links and invite you to the Discord channel we’ll be using for keeping in touch throughout the event.


We hope you'll be able to join us! \
Mariana, Clayton, Philip, Ben, Luke and Colin
