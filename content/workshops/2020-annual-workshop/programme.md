PPIG 2020 will take place as two one-week-long virtual events in August (17th to 21st) and November (16th to 20th). During each of the two weeks, we'll meet for two to three hours a day for presentations, discussions, panels and social activities.

A more detailed schedule will be published closer to the time, and things might move around a bit, but our working programme outline for the upcoming summer session is:

- *Monday, 17th August*: Conference start, introductions and an icebreaker activity
- *Tuesday, 18th August*: Invited panel on programming for communities and open discussion
- *Wednesday, 19th August*: Paper presentations; invited artistic programming talk
- *Thursday, 20th August*: Paper presentations, CSEd discussion
- *Friday, 21st August*: Doctoral Consortium presentations, data science and software engineering discussion

Weâ€™ll be meeting each day starting at 4pm UK / 11am Eastern / 8am Pacific for about 2 hours of scheduled content, followed by up to one extra hour of social activities.

We hope you'll be able to join us! \
Mariana, Luke, Clayton, Philip, Ben and Colin
