PPIG 1999 Report #2 & Photos
============================

**[11th Annual Workshop](/node/105)**  
5-7 January 1999  
Computer-Based Learning Unit, University of Leeds, UK

**By Nigel Birch**

January 1999, and a typically British winter, damp, cold and gloomy. In the occasional glimpses of sun through the gloom, the usual eclectic mix of PPIGlets gathered at Fairbairn House in Leeds (interestingly, for an old building, no one was claiming that Queen Elizabeth slept there. Queen Victoria did, though!).

The event started on 4 January with the postdoc consortium. This was followed by the PPIG 'do -it - yourself' (or bricolage as they say in France - see later) ceilidh.

The guest speakers were Russel Winder and Françoise Détienne.

"Get the roof" said Thos, hence the odd angle, achieved by the subjects standing at the top of the stairs into the hall and the photographer lying sprawled on the floor at the bottom.

A feature of PPIG is the informal discussions. Here are some informal discussants: Paul Mulholland, Judith Good and Alan Blackwell are some of those seen here discussing the merits of the coffee.

Downstairs in a cosier room. A bit thin on the ground. Coffee too good?

The Prizes
----------

No PPIG would be complete without the prize-giving ceremony for the announced and unannounced competitions. Herewith a selection of this year's winners (camera film allowing).

![](/sites/default/files/p17_0.jpg)

Mordechai Ben Ari, for the Best New Word at a PPIG Meeting - bricolage.

![](/sites/default/files/p18_0.jpg)

Russel Winder, for the Most Distracting Background to the Slides (what he would have got if the sound had been working we'll never know).

![](/sites/default/files/p19_1.jpg)

Amnart Pohthong, for Being Prepared and standing in when one of our invited speakers couldn't get here. Amnart had come with a prepared talk, just in case. He even had some overheads. And it was just as well for us.

![](/sites/default/files/p20_0.jpg)

Jeff Feddon, for Sheer Helpfulness: brains in solving problems, brawn in carrying out the solutions, and even turned out to be an excellent guitarist.

![](/sites/default/files/p21_0.jpg)

Simon Holland, for his Lastest Minute Registration. This was keenly contested, two people managing to send last minute bookings in while Thos was demounting the online registration form, but Simon actually managed to get a booking made after it had been disabled.

Quiz Master Extraordinaire Chris Douce (as a member of the team that came second, all I can say is we was robbed).

Saja, for the person who actually Showed us Some REAL CODE.
