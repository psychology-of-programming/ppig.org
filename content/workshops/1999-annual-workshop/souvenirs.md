January 1999, and a typically British winter, damp, cold and gloomy. In the occasional glimpses of sun through the gloom, the usual eclectic mix of PPIGlets gathered at Fairbairn House in Leeds (interestingly, for an old building, no one was claiming that Queen Elizabeth slept there. Queen Victoria did, though!).

The event started on 4 January with the postdoc consortium. This was followed by the PPIG 'do-it-yourself' (or bricolage as they say in France - see later) ceilidh.

The Prizes
----------

No PPIG would be complete without the prize-giving ceremony for the announced and unannounced competitions. Herewith a selection of this year's winners (camera film allowing).

|    |    |
| ---|--- |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p17_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Mordechai Ben Ari, for the Best New Word at a PPIG Meeting - bricolage. |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p18_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Russel Winder, for the Most Distracting Background to the Slides (what he would have got if the sound had been working we'll never know). |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p19_1.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Amnart Pohthong, for Being Prepared and standing in when one of our invited speakers couldn't get here. Amnart had come with a prepared talk, just in case. He even had some overheads. And it was just as well for us. |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p20_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Jeff Feddon, for Sheer Helpfulness: brains in solving problems, brawn in carrying out the solutions, and even turned out to be an excellent guitarist. |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p21_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Simon Holland, for his Lastest Minute Registration. This was keenly contested, two people managing to send last minute bookings in while Thos was demounting the online registration form, but Simon actually managed to get a booking made after it had been disabled. |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p24_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Quiz Master Extraordinaire Chris Douce (as a member of the team that came second, all I can say is we was robbed). |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p26_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Saja, for the person who actually Showed us Some REAL CODE. |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p22_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | The remaining prizes were awarded to Pablo Romero. |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p23_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | Fabrice Retkowsky, for Patience and Fortitude for sitting through the quiz after accidentally disqualifying himself by having an e-mail sent to him with all the answers. |
| {{< figure src="/img/ppig-1999/p25_0.jpg" class="h6 w5" >}} | James Aczel and others, for presenting the Paper with the Most Authors. |

That's it. See you next year in Calabria.
