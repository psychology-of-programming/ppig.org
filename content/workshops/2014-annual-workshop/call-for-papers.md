### Deadline extended from 25th March to 31st March 2014

We invite papers concerned with psychological aspects of software development. PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience, and is equally concerned with all aspects of programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice.

Despite its title, PPIG is interested not only in psychology of programming and software engineering, but also in psychological aspects of related activities where people meet formal structures. Indeed, a feature of the PPIG workshops has always been their openness: although principally related to programming and software engineering, recent events have touched on learning mathematical formalisms, creativity and digital design, understanding websites, and live coding in the laptop music world. Similarly, PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological and social theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real‐world experience. We have open minds: if you think we might be interested, try us.

As this is the 25th Anniversary Workshop we are also interested in review papers that draw together a theme from the last 25 years.

Some themes to prompt you:

- Empirical studies of programming
- Programming education and skills acquisition
- Human centered design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and infrastructure
- Programming and human cognition
- Human Computer Interaction issues in programming
- Team/cooperative work in programming
- End user programming
- Distributed programming, globalisation, work in large teams
- Free/libre open source software development
- Software engineering methods, planning, estimation, agility etc.
- Gender, age, culture and programming
- New paradigms in programming
- Code quality, readability and re‐use
- Mistakes, bugs, and error handling
- Working with notation
- Specialist and domain centered programming tools and languages
- Unconventional interactions and quasi‐progamming

Other approaches and insights are welcome.

## Submission

<u>Full Papers</u> should be 12 pages or less. Authors may also submit a 6 page <u>Short Paper</u> or a <u>Work in Progress Report</u>, clearly marked as such, to describe conjectural, late‐breaking or tentative results. The refereeing process will be suitably lighter.  As in previous years, the Programme Committee will review all submitted papers and, based on their reviews, each accepted paper will be classified as a "Full Technical Paper" or a "Work in Progress Report".  All papers accepted for presentation at PPIG 2014 will appear in the workshop proceedings and be archived on the PPIG website.

To format your paper, please use the [PPIG Word Template](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/bend/ppig2014/ppig2014.dot) or a [LaTeX description](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/bend/ppig2014/ppig2014.pdf). ~~available from the website http://www.ppig.org/templates/~~

Note that the templates currently (21st February 2014) refer to earlier PPIG conferences.  This will be fixed.

Papers should be submitted via EasyChair in PDF format via  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2014

## Doctoral Consortium

The Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop will again host a doctoral consortium. The event is for research students at all stages of doctoral study. The event will include brief introductions by each of the student participants (on the order of 10 minutes, plus time for questions, depending on the number of students involved) and interactive sessions on the process and nature of Ph.D. research. Experienced researchers, in addition to the organisers, will participate as 'discussants' to add different perspectives and to provide feedback on individual research programs.  Submission: applications must provide an overview of your research (max 6 pages) and be submitted via  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2014 as for other papers.
