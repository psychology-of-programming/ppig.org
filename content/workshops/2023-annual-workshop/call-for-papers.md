The 34th Annual Workshop of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) will take place from Aug 21 - Aug 25.  This will be a hybrid virtual/physical meeting hosted by Lund University.  We aim to make it worthwhile to join us in Lund, Sweden, but you will also have the alternative of presenting and interacting fully with all presentations remotely from your home, office, tent or boat, as well as taking part in integrated online activities.

This year’s theme is <span class="sketch-emph">sketching</span> - what are possible relationships between programming programming, people, psychology, and provisional ideas.
So, for example, papers might draw inspiration regarding:
* Creativity (including metaphors and inspiration)
* Notations and annotations
* Sensory-motor experience
* Craft skills
* Evolution and adaptation of works
* Liveness and interactivity

Provisional ideas happen in many (all?) disciplines. What can we learn about how to program from them? Sources of inspiration could include a sculptor’s sketches of their future work, messy marks in a calendar, your children’s doodles. Equally, we could consider rough drawings of boxes and lines, flow charts, and train scheduling diagrams.

Of course, as ever, any PPIG-relevant papers will be welcomed.

## BACKGROUND

PPIG was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology. “Programming”, here, is interpreted in the broadest sense to include any aspect of software creation. As always with PPIG, besides this year’s theme of sketching, we welcome a wide range of submissions on a variety of topics, such as:

- Programming and human cognition
- Programming education and craft skill acquisition
- Human centred design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and infrastructure
- Team/co-operative work in programming
- End-user programming, end-user development
- Distributed programming, programming distribution
- Gender, age, culture and programming
- New paradigms in programming
- Code quality, readability, productivity and re-use
- Mistakes, bugs and errors
- Notational design
- Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming
- Non-human programming
- Technology support for creativity
- Music(al) programming
- Liveness and interactivity in programming

## DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM

Doctoral students are warmly invited to submit work to the PPIG Doctoral Consortium, which has gained a reputation for being helpful, constructive and unthreatening.

Students who would benefit from financial support to attend the conference should get in touch with mariana.marasoiu@cl.cam.ac.uk.

## SUBMISSIONS

We welcome the following categories of submissions:

- Full Papers: usually less than 10 pages, but no explicit limit - as long as the reader’s interest is maintained
- Short Work-In-Progress papers: about 4 pages, but use more if needed
- Reflections, artworks, and system demonstrations, about 1 page as an extended abstract, but use more if needed
- Doctoral consortium submissions: about 2 pages, but use more if needed

**Please use [our templates](/author-resources/paper-templates) for papers. Submissions for the workshop should be uploaded to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2023).**

## IMPORTANT DATES

*Full papers* and *Work-in-Progress papers*:
* Abstract: as soon as possible, at latest **May 15**
* Paper submission deadline: **June 1**

*Doctoral Consortium papers* and *Artworks/Demos*:
* Submission deadline: **June 15**.

*Authors will be notified:* by **July 1**

*Conference*: **August 21-25**

*Camera-ready submission deadline*: **Oct 1**
* PPIG uses a post-proceedings process, so that authors can incorporate the workshop discussion and feedback into their final paper.


## CONFERENCE FORMAT

This will be a hybrid physical/virtual meeting consisting of a full week of paper presentations and keynotes in the afternoons and 2-3 days of in-person activities, a format that worked successfully last year. Details of the mix of activities and day to day timings will be provided closer to the time.
