The conference will be hosted by the Computer Science department at Lund University, Sweden. For directions, you can check the [department webpage](https://cs.lth.se/about/directions/) which has a map of its [location](https://cs.lth.se/fileadmin/cs/Maps/E-huset_intro_EN-suroundings.pdf).

The main conference room for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday will be the M:Teknodromen, in the M-building [1]. For folks who want to stay on for Thursday and Friday's afternoon online sessions, we've booked the smaller E:2405 meeting room in the E-building [2]. The Doctoral Consortium on Monday will also take place in the E:2405 meeting room.

On Monday and Tuesday evening, we'll have some social activities and experiences organised at the [Vattenhallen Science Center](https://www.vattenhallen.lu.se/english/) and [Museum of Sketches](https://skissernasmuseum.se/en/) respectively.

And finally, if you'd like to arrive early or stay on and see more of Lund, [visitlund.se](https://visitlund.se/en) is a good starting point for what's on and other things to see.

### Department of Computer Science

The [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.lth.se/english/) belongs to the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University. It offers undergraduate and graduate-level education in Computer Science, both within the educational programs in engineering and science, as well as giving individual courses on chosen topics. There are six research groups in the department.

* [Algorithms](https://cs.lth.se/english/algorithms/)
* [Computer Graphics](https://graphics.cs.lth.se/)
* [Embedded Systems Design](https://esd.cs.lth.se/)
* [Robots and Semantic Systems](https://rss.cs.lth.se/)
* [Software Development Research](https://sde.cs.lth.se/)
* [Software Engineering](https://serg.cs.lth.se/)

The [Faculty of Engineering (LTH)](https://www.lth.se/english/) is one of the largest faculties at Lund University. It is also one of the newest additions to the 350-year history of the University - the faculty was founded in 1961 and became part of Lund University from 1969.

### Vattenhallen Science Center

[Vattenhallen Science Center](https://www.vattenhallen.lu.se/english/) opened in September 2009. It has, during a normal year, about 45,000 visitors who from all over the region. Every day 150 school students come to experience science and during the spring- and autumn semesters students from junior high and high school do their internship (praktik) or work study programs (prao) in Vattenhallen. They are open to the public on weekends and school holidays, and welcome everyone to try out interactive experiments, attend a show or see an exhibition.

Vattenhallen is a science center at Lund University. Departments at the University and local businesses have contributed their expertise and knowledge in the development of new experiments. Many teachers and researchers have also been active in meetings with school-children and other visitors to Vattenhallen, which has helped achieve their aim of being a meeting place for the university, schools, industry, regions and the wider public.

### Museum of Sketches

[Skissernas Museum – Museum of Artistic Process and Public Art](https://skissernasmuseum.se/en/) is a unique art museum that focuses on the artistic creative process. It features the world’s largest collection of sketches, models and preparatory work for Swedish and international public art.

The large exhibition rooms hold modern and contemporary art – from small pencil drawings to colourful, monumental paintings and large-scale plaster sculptures. There are sketches by international artists such as Henri Matisse, Sonia Delaunay, Henry Moore and Fernand Léger, and one of Europe’s foremost collections of sketches by Mexican monumental painters such as Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. The Swedish Gallery exhibits works by Sigrid Hjertén, Isaac Grünewald and Siri Derkert and contemporary artists such as Linn Fernström, Gerhard Nordström and Matthias van Arkel. In addition to the permanent exhibitions, the museum presents a series of new temporary exhibitions every year, featuring both contemporary and earlier artists. In addition, a rich and varied program is on offer for children, teens and adults with guided tours, artists’ talks, lectures, concerts, performances, creative workshops and much more. The museum also has an extensive image and clip archives on public art from Swedish and international newspapers and magazines from the 1930s until today.
