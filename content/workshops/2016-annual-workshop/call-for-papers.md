The Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) will meet from the 8th to the 10th of September 2016, in Cambridge, UK. It will be colocated with [VL/HCC](https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2016/).

PPIG is interested in psychological issues in programming and software engineering, and more generally, what happens anytime people meet formal structures.

We've covered how people learn mathematical notations, how to make programming more usable, issues in supporting creativity in design and the prospects for live coding laptop music. PPIG supports a correspondingly broad spectrum of research approaches from psychological, philosophical and social theory to quantitative and experience reports.

We have open minds, and are more interested in creative or risky ideas than polished 'correctness'. If you think we might be interested, give us a try.

In 2016 we would especially welcome submissions for "PPIG in the classroom" and "PPIG in the wild". That is: papers addressing PPIG issues associated with teaching and education, and PPIG issues associated with professional practice in programming design and tooling.

We will welcome two broad categories of submissions:

**Papers: ([Templates are available to download](/content/author-resources/paper-templates.md))**

Full Papers: Up to 10 pages long.

Work In Progress reports: Up to 4 pages long.

Doctoral consortium submissions: Up to 2 pages long.

System demonstrations and reflections: Please submit an abstract, video, or artwork outlining what you will present. Crashes are acceptable. Up to 3 days long.

**Submissions for both categories should be sent by the 23rd of May, 2016\. Doctoral consortium submissions are due on the 4th of July, 2016.**

Limited funding may be available to support travel for doctoral consortium submissions. Please get in touch for details.

Submissions can be uploaded via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2016).

If you're stuck to think of things we might find interesting, here are some themes to prompt:

*   Empirical studies of programming
*   Liveness and interactivity in programming
*   Programming education and skills acquisition
*   Human centered design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and infrastructure
*   Programming and human cognition
*   Team/co-operative work in programming
*   End user programming
*   Distributed programming, programming distribution
*   Software engineering methods, planning, estimation
*   Gender, age, culture and programming
*   New paradigms in programming
*   Code quality, readability, productivity and re-use
*   Mistakes, bugs and errors
*   Notational design
*   Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming
*   Non-human programming

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:workshop@ppig.org?subject=PPIG%202016).

I look forwards to seeing you in Cambridge.
