In 2017 we’re especially interested in the psychology of programming as a form of artistic expression. We encourage authors to look beyond the traditional stomping grounds of programming and consider other domains.

PPIG has a tradition of breadth. Our previous discussion ranged from CS education topics to software engineering, programming music, robots and collaboration. The philosophy of computation, visual programming languages and programming language design are all in scope.

We have open minds, and enjoy conversations around creative and risky ideas more than polished 'correctness'. If you think we might be interested, give us a try.

We will welcome the following categories of submissions:

- Full Papers: Up to 10 pages long.
- Work In Progress reports: Up to 4 pages long.
- System demonstrations and reflections: an abstract, video, or artwork outlining what you will present. Crashes are desirable. Up to 2.5 days long.
- Doctoral consortium submissions: Up to 2 pages long.

Please use our [templates for papers](about/templates).

Submissions are due as follows:

- ~~Abstract submission deadline: 15th of April, 2017~~
- Paper submission deadline: ~~1st of May, 2017~~, **extended until 15th of May, 2017!**
- Doctoral consortium submissions deadline: 1st of May, 2017

Limited funding may be available to support travel for doctoral consortium submissions. Please get in touch for details.

**Papers for the workshop should be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppig2017)**. Submissions should be in PDF format.

If you’re stuck to think of things we might find interesting, here are some themes to prompt:

- Abstract art as abstract programming
- Concrete art as concrete programming
- Music(al) programming
- Liveness and interactivity in programming
- Programming education and skills acquisition
- Human centered design and evaluation of programming languages, tools and infrastructure
- Programming and human cognition
- Team/co-operative work in programming
- End user programming
- Distributed programming, programming distribution
- Software engineering methods, planning, estimation
- Gender, age, culture and programming
- New paradigms in programming
- Code quality, readability, productivity and re-use
- Mistakes, bugs and errors
- Notational design
- Unconventional interactions and quasi-programming
- Non-human programming
- Technology support for creativity

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

We look forwards to seeing you in Delft.
