*Update*: The full programme is now [available](/workshops/2021-annual-workshop/programme).

*Update*: There can't be a typical PPIG without games and fun, so this year's main [competition](/workshops/2021-annual-workshop/competition) invites you to submit comics, cartoons, short videos etc. reinterpreting your colleagues' presentations. Moreover, one of the social events consists of [game-making in small groups](/workshops/2021-annual-workshop/write-a-game-evening), followed by game-playing in one of the subsequent evenings. We look forwards to seeing your contributions!

<br>

Due to a larger number of submissions than we initially expected (a big thank you to the authors for their contributions!), and as we'd like to allow for sufficient time for discussion, we're extending the schedule to 3 hours per day, so **from 3:30pm to 6:30pm British Summer Time** (= UTC plus 1 hour). After 6:30pm there will be optional social events such as virtual tours and game creation, to which everyone is encouraged to join!

Registration is open on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ppig-2021-32nd-annual-workshop-tickets-156385512277). Please make sure to register there so we can share the zoom links and further information with you.


If you have any questions please email them to thosgreen@gmail.com.

We look forward to seeing you soon! \
