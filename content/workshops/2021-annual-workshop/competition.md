Everyone is invited to make a comic, a cartoon, a very short video, or a mashup of some kind. Points for humour,
unexpectedness, topicality etc. The idea is to draw on the slides used in the presentations for the
major art of the graphics, although obviously you are allowed to decorate, distort, and demolish
them – politely. Themes might be (parodies welcome) – these or any other you think of
- a fragment of a Greek tragedy or Disney movie
- a moment from Shakespeare, or anyone else, including well-known films
- a memorable event
- lyrics for a song (and you can sing it too if you like)
- a day (well, a short period) in the life of ... a starfish? a politician? a software engineer? a
musician?
- a scene from Alternative Literature – as defined by you
- a comment on one of the papers

## Material
All speakers are requested (or anyway, encouraged) to put copies of their slides into this Google
Drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H6rZl8yYOM5mo_2_KItUmaR_jDorjA_k . Please do it as soon as possible, so that competitors have material to work with. (You’ll
have to sign into your Google account – if that’s not on, please send them to Luke Church at
luke@church.name and he’ll put them into the folder for you.)

## Submitting your entry
Please submit it by putting a copy in this second Google Drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kLCwxTNizUpa19Su0slGjCWS3jJ1UFDg . If you make a video, please use one of the
more accustomed formats – or save it YouTube and send a link. Don’t forget to include your name or
other identifier. (As above: if you have problems, send instead to Luke luke@church.name.)

JUDGING WILL PROBABLY BE LATE ON THURSDAY so please get your entry (-ies) in in good time.

## Judging
Let’s have some public voting. Everyone is invited to view the entries in the second Google Drive folder and rate
them. Please give points out of 10 for each entry you wish to judge (10 good, 0 less good) and email the
list to Alan Blackwell afb21@cam.ac.uk **by Thursday lunchtime**, say 1:00pm BST.
The prize committee (led by Alan Blackwell) will also view the entries and form their conclusions
based on their own opinion and public voting.
