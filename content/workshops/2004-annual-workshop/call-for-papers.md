PPIG 2004 Call for Participation
================================



Enda Dunican from the Institute of Technology, Carlow, Ireland will be hosting the [16th Annual PPIG workshop](/node/110) between Monday 5th April 2004 and Wednesday 7th April.

A featured theme at PPIG 2004 will be research in the area of computer science education. The authors of selected papers submitted in this area will be invited to develop their papers for submission to a special issue of the Computer Science Education (CSE) journal to appear in 2005. Papers covering other topics of interest to the PPIG community (including work-in-progress papers) are also invited and welcomed.

Aims and Scope
--------------

The annual PPIG workshop is a forum in which researchers concerned with cognitive factors in software engineering can present and discuss recent results, findings and developments.

A feature of the PPIG workshops has been their openness to a wide spectrum of concerns related to programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams, and from computing education to high-performance professional practice. Similarly, PPIG entertains a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience.

Despite its name, PPIG aims to bring together people working in a variety of disciplines and to break down cross-disciplinary barriers.

Doctoral/Postgraduate Event at PPIG-2004
----------------------------------------

During the morning of 5th April we will be holding a doctoral event for postgraduate students. The aim of this session is for postgraduates to present their research and exchange ideas with their fellow students as well as getting feedback from experienced research supervisors who will be attending the session. This session is free and open to all postgraduate students attending the event. Furthermore we are hoping to subsidise students who wish to attend this event. Details of the level of subsidy will follow later.

Registration
------------

The deadline for registration will be 5th March.

Getting To Carlow
-----------------

_By Bus:_ From Dublin Airport get the 747 route buses to Bus Aras (Central Bus Station) in the city centre where you can get a bus (Bus Eireann Coach) directly to Carlow. To plan your journey look at [www.buseireann.ie](http://www.buseireann.ie/), then click on:

*   From : Dublin (Busaras)
*   To : Carlow (IT)

_By Train:_ From Dublin Airport get the 748 route buses to Heuston Station where you can get a train directly to Carlow. To plan your journey look at [www.irishrail.ie](http://www.irishrail.ie/), then click on:

*   Your journey : timetables-journey planner
*   From : Heuston
*   To : Carlow

It can be sometimes just as easy to get a bus from Dublin Airport to the city centre and then a bus/taxi from the quays (crossing O'Connell Bridge coming from O'Connell St side) to Heuston station. Most of the buses to Heuston Rail Station leave from bus stops outside the Virgin Megastores store.

_By Car:_ The AA and RAC websites provide excellent information on travelling to Carlow which basically involves travelling southbound to get onto the M9/M7 motorway which is the main Dublin Waterford route.

Getting to the Institute
------------------------

The Institute of Technology is approx .5 km from town centre on the main Kilkenny Road. The main entrance is via a slip road on the left hand side just before Munnelly's garage/filling station. When you arrive on the campus you should enter the Learning Resource Centre (LRC) which can be accessed via the door close to the 'Portal of Light', a piece of art consisting of two large granite stones with something resembling a light sabre penetrating them.
