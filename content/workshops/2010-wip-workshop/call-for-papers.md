# PPIG WIP 2010 Call for Papers
---------------

### Submission of extended abstracts (1 to 2 pages)

_16th November 2010_

The Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) invites software engineers and researchers to submit abstracts for its 6th Work-in-Progress meeting, to be held at the School of Computing at the University of Dundee, Scotland.

The PPIG work-in-progress workshop is a forum in which researchers at all levels can present and discuss current work, recent results and developments concerned with psychological aspects of software development.

A feature of the PPIG workshops has been their openness to a wide spectrum of concerns related to programming and software engineering, from the design of programming languages to communication issues in software teams and from computing education to high-performance professional practice.

Similarly, PPIG encourages a broad spectrum of research approaches, from theoretical perspectives drawing on psychological theory to empirical perspectives grounded in real-world experience.
