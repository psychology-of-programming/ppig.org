Walking along the blustery Bournemouth beach we found ourselves in our luxury hotel, where we were free to enjoy its extensive facilities..

Some facilities were used more ...

... than others.

where old friends got to meet and ...

... discuss many interesting (and important!) issues.

Soon, introductions were made ...

... and the presentations commenced, ...

... where many interesting points were made, followed by questions from the audience.

The following evening, some of us participated in a quiz, ...

... where it was not only the questions that were surprising!

Rivalry was intense, ...

... but there was only one winning team.

We agree! A successful workshop!

But all good things have to come to an end, we say. As we pack up our things ...

... and head for home, ...

... the Brunel can be seen in the distance.
