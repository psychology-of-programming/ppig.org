# PPIG Workshop: 2009

[2009-06-21st](/workshop/ppig-2009-21st-annual-workshop)

_To complement the end results of [PPIG Limerick](/node/115) for Limerick competition, I must to share an abridged version of the competition rules. Many thanks to **Dermot Shinners-Kennedy** for composing this fine opus._

To participate you must try writing verse for a while  
Adhering to a special type of rhythm and rhyming style  
Because of these tricks  
The verses are called limericks  
And really good ones can make people break into a smile

The PPIG community has people with all sorts of degrees  
And maybe some of them can pen limericks with ease  
But by way of example  
We offer this little sample  
As a guide, or for some maybe a tease

Technically speaking these sample verses are not right  
They rhyme correct but have rhythm errors that are slight  
So write just for fun  
Five rhyming lines of pun  
And we promise to keep verse-pedants well out of sight

It would be great if from every attendee  
We received works we could call literary  
So we invite you to submit  
Stylish verses with some wit  
About the 21st psychology of programming jamboree

To “PPIG things” the verse should try to make reference  
Well to begin with that is definitely our preference  
But we will not inhibit  
A literary exhibit  
Which to our guidelines shows a degree of indifference

For example, when listening to an inspired paper or keynote  
It may trigger recollection of an amusing anecdote  
Just jot down five lines  
With appropriate rhymes  
If people like it you have our permission to gloat

Or maybe you are a conference paper presenter  
With the insight of a creative inventor  
In your presentation implant  
A rhyming five-line rant  
That encapsulates what your presentation has as its centre

There is no limit to the number of entries you can submit  
But try to keep them all amusing and if possible literate  
For tenure they won’t count  
But depending on the amount  
You may discover you have a compulsive verse writing habit

Rewarding the best entries is a problem that arises  
And for this the conference organisers are offering two prizes  
One for verse in presentations  
The other for gestalt observations  
The best wordsmiths can look forward to some little surprises

It’s the judge’s decision that will finally end it  
And unfortunately some entrants may be offended  
If you need to whinge or moan  
Please try to do it when alone  
Because we want to make sure the prize-winners feel totally splendid

So whilst in Limerick indulging your favourite research antic  
Having travelled across or towards the Atlantic  
Use all your common sense  
Exploit real or artificial intelligence  
And let’s make the number of verse submissions absolutely gigantic
