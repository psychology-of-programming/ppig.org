## What is PPIG?
The Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology.

'Programming', here, is interpreted in the broadest sense to include any aspect of software development.

The group, which at present numbers approximately 300 world-wide, includes cognitive scientists, psychologists, computer scientists, software engineers, software developers, HCI people et al., in both universities and industry.

PPIG aims to provide a forum for the rapid dissemination of results, ideas, and language or paradigm tool development, circumventing the long time-lag of conferences and journals. It does this by maintaining two [mailing lists](mailing-lists) - one for announcements and one for discussion, and organising [workshops](workshops) - an annual international workshop and other work-in-progress or topic-focused workshops as and when required.
